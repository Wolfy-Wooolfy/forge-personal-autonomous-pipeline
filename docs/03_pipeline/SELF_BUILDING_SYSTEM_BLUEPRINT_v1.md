# 📘 SELF-BUILDING SYSTEM BLUEPRINT (Forge)

Version: v1.0  
Status: EXECUTION-BOUND  
Authority: CTO  
Applies To: Entire Forge Runtime  
Enforcement Level: HARD (Fail-Closed)

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the architecture and execution logic
required to transform Forge into a self-building,
governed autonomous engineering system.

The objective is:

To allow Forge to start from any entry point:
- Idea only
- Documents only
- Code only
- Documents + Code

And autonomously proceed toward:
- Structured documentation
- Verified implementation
- Gap closure
- Controlled execution
- Deterministic closure

Under strict governance and decision control.

---

# 2. Core Objective

Forge MUST be capable of:

1. Starting from an idea
2. Starting from existing documentation
3. Starting from existing code
4. Combining documentation and code
5. Detecting gaps
6. Proposing structural improvements
7. Escalating decisions when ambiguity exists
8. Executing only after confirmed decisions
9. Producing deterministic artifacts
10. Closing stages with auditable evidence

---

# 3. Mandatory Execution Modules

The following modules MUST exist as first-class runtime components.

---

## 3.1 Intake Module

Purpose:
Determine starting context.

Input Types:
- IDEA
- DOCUMENTS
- CODE
- DOCUMENTS + CODE

Responsibilities:
- Detect input mode
- Register project context
- Create structured project registry entry
- Initialize execution scope

Output:
- intake_report.json

---

## 3.2 Audit Module

Purpose:
Analyze documentation structure and governance quality.

Responsibilities:
- Detect missing sections
- Detect weak/non-enforceable language
- Extract requirements
- Validate structural completeness

Output:
- docs_audit_report.json

---

## 3.3 Trace Module

Purpose:
Build deterministic mapping.

Mappings:
- Docs → Requirements
- Requirements → Code
- Code → Docs

Output:
- trace_matrix.json

---

## 3.4 Gap Module

Purpose:
Identify inconsistencies.

Types of Gaps:
- Documented but not implemented
- Implemented but undocumented
- Decision ambiguity
- Structural inconsistency

Output:
- gap_report.json

---

## 3.5 Design Exploration Module

Purpose:
Allow structured architectural discussion and controlled proposal evaluation
before final decision escalation.

This module enables Forge to analyze improvement proposals,
identify risks, generate alternatives, and produce a recommendation
before invoking the Decision Gate.

Responsibilities:

- Analyze proposed architectural or structural changes
- Evaluate impact on system objectives, constraints, and governance rules
- Detect harmful or destabilizing proposals
- Generate alternative solution paths
- Produce structured comparison between available options
- Generate recommendation artifact

Outputs:

- proposal_analysis.json
- option_matrix.json
- recommendation_report.json

Authority Limits:

The Design Exploration Module MUST NOT:

- modify source code
- modify governance documents
- update execution status
- close stages
- bypass Decision Gate

This module is analytical only and produces artifacts
used by the Decision Gate for final decision escalation.

Governance References:

The Design Exploration Module MUST follow the rules defined in:

- docs/03_pipeline/DESIGN_EXPLORATION_PROTOCOL.md
- docs/07_decisions/OPTION_EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK.md
- docs/07_decisions/EXECUTION_FORK_DETECTION_RULES.md

These documents define:

- when exploration is allowed
- how alternatives are evaluated
- how forks are detected
- how recommendations are produced.

---

## 3.6 Decision Gate Module

Purpose:
Pause execution when multiple paths exist.

Conditions:
- More than one architectural option
- Risk tradeoff required
- Irreversible structural change

Execution Context:

Decision Gate operates AFTER Design Exploration
when multiple valid execution paths still exist.

If exploration resolves the fork deterministically
and only one valid path remains,
Decision Gate MUST NOT be triggered
and execution continues automatically.

Behavior:
- Halt execution
- Generate decision_request.json
- Await explicit confirmation

Execution MUST NOT continue without decision confirmation.

---

## 3.7 Backfill Module

Purpose:
Auto-generate missing structured artifacts.

May create:
- Missing documentation sections
- Missing coverage maps
- Missing tests
- Missing schema definitions

All generated content MUST be:
- Structured
- Versioned
- Traceable

---

## 3.8 Execute Module

Purpose:
Implement approved changes.

Rules:
- Only execute confirmed decisions
- Only modify versioned artifacts
- Must generate change_manifest.json

No free-form modification allowed.

---

## 3.9 Closure Module

Purpose:
Finalize stage deterministically.

Requirements:
- All modules complete
- All gaps resolved or accepted
- All decisions recorded
- All artifacts generated

Output:
- stage_closure_report.json

---

# 4. Governance Rules

1. No module may bypass Decision Gate.
2. No execution without artifact output.
3. No stage closure without verification.
4. No silent assumptions.
5. No free-form changes outside trace.
6. All modifications MUST reference origin artifact.

---

# 6. Fail-Closed Principle

If any of the following occurs:
- Missing artifact
- Unresolved gap
- Pending decision
- Inconsistent trace

Execution MUST stop.

---

# 7. Definition of Completion

Forge is considered fully self-building when:

- All modules exist
- All modules are executable
- Each module produces artifacts
- Execution can resume from any stage
- Decisions are enforceable
- No manual structural intervention required

---

# 8. Future Extensions

Future versions may introduce:

- Autonomous Improvement Loops
- Risk Scoring
- Architectural Simulation
- Confidence Scoring
- Economic Cost Estimation
- Refactor Recommendation Engine

But these MUST NOT be implemented before core modules are stable.
