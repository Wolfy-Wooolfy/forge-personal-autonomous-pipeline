# Code to Documentation Trace & Consistency Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-43
**Stage:** C
**Status:** BINDING – EXECUTION CONTRACT
**Applies To:** Stage C – Code Generation & Implementation
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines deterministic enforcement rules that bind:

- Source code
- Documentation contracts
- Artifacts
- Tests
- Execution behavior

Stage C MUST ensure that:

- Every code unit traces to an authoritative documentation source.
- No undocumented behavior exists.
- No documented requirement lacks implementation.
- Verification evidence is structurally provable.

Stage C is contract-bound implementation.

---

## 2. Authoritative Inputs (Fail-Closed)

Stage C accepts ONLY:

1) The fully closed Stage B documentation pack under `docs/`
2) Stage B closure evidence:

- `artifacts/stage_B/stage_B.reclosure.md`

If the Stage B closure artifact is missing:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

No external narrative input permitted.

---

## 3. Canonical Artifact Container Rule (DOC-21)

All Stage C verification artifacts MUST be Markdown containers (`.md`) that embed a single canonical JSON block.

- The embedded JSON MUST conform to the referenced schema under `docs/09_verify/*`.
- The Markdown wrapper MAY contain minimal headers, but MUST NOT contain narrative interpretation.

If artifact container format is violated:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

Reference:
- `docs/05_artifacts/Artifact_Serialization_and_Embedded_JSON_Rule.md` (DOC-21)

---

## 4. Trace Matrix Artifact (SCHEMA-03)

Stage C MUST produce a deterministic Trace Matrix artifact.

Path:
- `artifacts/stage_C/code_trace_matrix.md`

Embedded JSON MUST conform to:
- `docs/09_verify/trace_matrix_schema_v1.json` (SCHEMA-03)

Rules:
- Embedded JSON ONLY (schema-bound)
- Deterministic
- Immutable once written for a given task execution
- No narrative fields
- `additionalProperties` MUST NOT be introduced beyond the schema

If any required schema field is missing:
→ FAIL CLOSED.

If any MUST-level documented requirement has no implementation mapping:
→ FAIL CLOSED.

If any code unit has no authoritative requirement mapping:
→ FAIL CLOSED.

Partial trace is forbidden.

---

## 5. Mismatch Report Artifact (SCHEMA-04)

Stage C MUST produce a deterministic mismatch report.

Path:
- `artifacts/stage_C/code_mismatch_report.md`

Embedded JSON MUST conform to:
- `docs/09_verify/mismatch_report_schema_v1.json` (SCHEMA-04)

Rules:
- Embedded JSON ONLY (schema-bound)
- Deterministic
- No narrative
- Must include a reference to the trace matrix artifact via schema fields

If the mismatch report indicates unresolved mismatches:
→ Stage C MUST NOT close.

---

## 6. Verification Evidence Artifact (SCHEMA-05)

Stage C MUST produce verification evidence.

Path:
- `artifacts/stage_C/test_evidence.md`

Embedded JSON MUST conform to:
- `docs/09_verify/verification_evidence_schema_v1.json` (SCHEMA-05)

Rules:
- Evidence MUST be reproducible
- Evidence MUST reference concrete test execution outputs and files
- No narrative interpretation

If evidence is missing or non-verifiable:
→ FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 7. Deterministic Code Rules (Fail-Closed)

Stage C MUST enforce:

1) No function without documented authority.
2) No undocumented API endpoint.
3) No undocumented configuration behavior.
4) No silent fallback logic.
5) No TODO or placeholder logic in execution paths.
6) No unreachable code.
7) No duplicated responsibility across modules.

Violations → FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 8. Stage C Closure Condition (Scope-Limited)

Stage C MAY be considered closure-eligible ONLY if:

- `artifacts/stage_C/code_trace_matrix.md` exists and conforms to SCHEMA-03
- `artifacts/stage_C/code_mismatch_report.md` exists and conforms to SCHEMA-04
- `artifacts/stage_C/test_evidence.md` exists and conforms to SCHEMA-05
- The mismatch report indicates zero unresolved mismatches

If any of the above is not satisfied:
→ Stage C MUST remain open.

---

## 9. Non-Authority Clause

This document is an execution contract.
It MUST NOT be overridden by:
- chat-declared state
- external repositories
- narrative explanations

Only artifacts and contracts inside this repository are authoritative.
