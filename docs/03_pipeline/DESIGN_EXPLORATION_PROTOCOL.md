# Design Exploration Protocol

**Document ID:** DOC-48
**Status:** BINDING – EXPLORATION GOVERNANCE
**Scope:** Controlled Alternative Evaluation inside Lifecycle Stages
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the **controlled exploration protocol**
that governs how the system evaluates multiple valid alternatives
before execution continues.

Its goals are:

- Prevent arbitrary optimization
- Prevent scope expansion
- Enable structured comparison of alternatives
- Allow objective-driven evaluation
- Ensure proper escalation when a fork remains unresolved

Design Exploration is **analysis only**.

It does NOT grant authority to:

- modify scope
- introduce new behaviors
- redefine intent
- bypass decision governance

---

# 2. Definition of Design Exploration

Design Exploration is a bounded analytical activity
performed when the pipeline detects that:

- more than one valid execution path exists
- all alternatives are contract-compliant
- deterministic continuation is not possible without comparison

The goal of exploration is to:

- evaluate alternatives
- identify tradeoffs
- enforce constraints
- determine if one path becomes deterministically superior

If exploration does not reduce the fork to one path,
a **Decision escalation** is required.

---

# 3. Exploration Trigger Conditions

Design Exploration may begin ONLY if ALL conditions are true:

1. A valid execution fork exists.
2. All options are contract-compliant.
3. No deterministic rule selects exactly one option.
4. Objective authority exists (see Project Objective Contract).

If objective authority is missing:

- Exploration MUST NOT occur
- Execution MUST escalate per fail-closed rules.

---

# 4. Exploration Scope Boundaries

Exploration MUST remain strictly within the accepted scope.

Exploration MUST NOT:

- introduce new features
- invent additional alternatives
- reinterpret requirements
- modify success criteria
- alter lifecycle structure

If evaluation suggests a new path
that is outside accepted scope:

- Exploration MUST stop
- A new task MUST be initiated

---

# 5. Allowed Exploration Activities

Exploration MAY include:

- structural comparison of alternatives
- complexity evaluation
- maintainability analysis
- deterministic behavior analysis
- constraint validation
- objective-based comparison

Exploration MUST remain artifact-driven.

Narrative reasoning alone has no authority.

---

# 6. Exploration Artifact Types

Exploration may produce the following artifacts:

### 6.1 Exploration Artifact

Contains:

- list of alternatives
- constraint compliance results
- objective comparison

Purpose:

- document evaluation steps

Authority:

ZERO execution authority.

---

### 6.2 Recommendation Artifact

Contains:

- evaluated alternatives
- objective comparison table
- constraint validation results
- tradeoff analysis
- recommended option

Purpose:

- assist human decision escalation

Authority:

ZERO execution authority.

Recommendation artifacts MUST NOT:

- select final execution path
- replace Decision artifacts
- modify stage authority

---

# 7. Exploration Completion Outcomes

Exploration may end in one of three outcomes.

---

## 7.1 Deterministic Resolution

If exploration determines that:

- only one path remains valid
- other paths violate constraints
- objective authority clearly disqualifies alternatives

Then:

- execution MAY continue deterministically
- no Decision artifact is required

---

## 7.2 Human Decision Required

If multiple valid paths remain after exploration:

- the system MUST escalate to human authority
- a Recommendation Artifact MUST be generated
- execution MUST pause at the current stage

Only a Decision artifact may resolve the fork.

---

## 7.3 Exploration Failure

Exploration fails if:

- objective authority is missing
- constraints are undefined
- alternatives cannot be evaluated deterministically

In this case:

- execution MUST halt
- escalation is required

---

# 8. Exploration Location in Lifecycle

Exploration may occur only inside active stages.

Allowed locations:

- Stage A — Idea refinement
- Stage B — Documentation structure decisions
- Stage C — Implementation path comparison

Exploration MUST NOT:

- create a new lifecycle stage
- bypass stage entry rules
- bypass stage exit rules

---

# 9. Exploration Authority Rules

Exploration artifacts have:

- no stage authority
- no transition authority
- no closure authority

Only closure artifacts may:

- close stages
- trigger lifecycle transitions

Exploration artifacts are analytical only.

---

# 10. Decision Escalation Integration

If exploration ends with multiple valid alternatives:

1. A Recommendation Artifact MUST be generated.
2. The execution fork MUST be escalated.
3. A human MUST issue a Decision.
4. The orchestrator MUST record the Decision artifact.

Exploration artifacts MUST remain separate
from Decision artifacts.

Decision artifacts remain minimal per governance rules.

---

# 11. Exploration Immutability

Once exploration artifacts are created:

- they MUST NOT be edited retroactively
- updates require a new artifact iteration

Artifacts remain historical records
for audit and traceability.

---

# 12. Prohibited Exploration Behavior

Exploration MUST NOT:

- optimize beyond objective authority
- refine scope implicitly
- introduce undocumented behavior
- bypass the Decision Gate
- perform autonomous selection when multiple paths exist

Any violation → SYSTEM FAILURE.

---

# 13. Exploration Traceability

Every exploration artifact MUST reference:

- the triggering artifact
- the stage where exploration occurred
- the evaluated alternatives
- constraint validation outcome

Traceability ensures that exploration remains auditable.

---

# 14. Deterministic Exploration Guarantee

Exploration is deterministic only if:

- alternatives are explicitly defined
- constraints are explicit
- objective authority exists
- evaluation artifacts are recorded

If determinism cannot be proven:

→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 15. Summary

Design Exploration is a controlled analytical activity
that exists to evaluate valid alternatives
without introducing new authority.

Key rules:

- Exploration does not grant execution authority.
- Exploration cannot change scope.
- Exploration cannot bypass decisions.
- Exploration may only support deterministic continuation
  or human decision escalation.

Exploration ensures that evaluation remains structured,
auditable, and bounded by intent.
