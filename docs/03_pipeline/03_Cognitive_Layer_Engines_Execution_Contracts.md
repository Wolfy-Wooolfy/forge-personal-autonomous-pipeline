# 📄 Document 11 — Cognitive Layer Engines Execution Contracts (v1)

**Project:** Forge
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** BINDING – NON-NEGOTIABLE
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C execution loops and their validators
**Enforcement Level:** HARD (Fail-Closed)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative, execution-grade contracts for the Cognitive Layer that sits above the Pipeline Engine.

The Cognitive Layer is composed of three deterministic engines:

1) **Idea Engine** (Stage A)
2) **Documentation Refinement Engine** (Stage B)
3) **Code↔Docs Consistency & Verification Engine** (Stage C + Stage D verification alignment)

These engines MUST operate under:
- Pipeline Stages Specification (Doc-03)
- Progress Tracking & Status Report Contract (Doc-06)
- Autonomy Policy & Human Interrupt Protocol (Doc-04)
- Forge Boundary Audit Rules (DOC-08)
- Build & Verify Playbook (Local) (Doc-09)
- Artifact Schema & Repository Layout Standard (Doc-05)

This document does NOT introduce new stage IDs, new progress semantics, or alternative status formats.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Principles

### 2.1 Execution-Only Intelligence

The Cognitive Layer may produce:
- Candidates
- Gap reports
- Trace matrices
- Mismatch reports
- Deterministic validators (PASS/FAIL outputs)

It MUST NOT:
- Infer new scope
- Add new requirements
- Optimize beyond explicit contracts
- Treat probabilistic outputs as authoritative

All probabilistic outputs are Candidates and MUST NOT mutate authoritative state without deterministic acceptance.

---

### 2.2 Fail-Closed Supremacy

If any engine cannot proceed deterministically:
- Execution MUST halt under Doc-03 rules
- State MUST be represented via governed runtime authority artifacts, with human-visible reflection emitted through `progress/status.json` per Doc-06
- A Human Interrupt is permitted ONLY per Doc-04 conditions

No engine is allowed to continue “temporarily”.

---

### 2.3 Authority Isolation

Each engine is bound by:
- Upstream closed artifacts
- Its declared inputs
- Its declared outputs

No cross-stage repair is permitted (Doc-03).

---

## 3. Engine 1 — Idea Engine Contract (Stage A)

### 3.1 Objective

Transform raw intent into:
- A frozen, execution-grade Idea Final Spec
- A deterministic evaluation record
- A bounded set of blocking questions (ONLY if mandatory)

### 3.2 Inputs (Authoritative)

- Human intent provided to Stage A
- Closed governance contracts (Doc-03/04/05/06/08/09)

### 3.3 Outputs (Required Artifacts)

Stage A MUST produce closed artifacts as defined by Doc-03 Stage A outputs.
This document additionally binds the execution behavior:

- If multiple equally valid interpretations exist:
  - Stage A MUST enter BLOCKED per Doc-06 rules
  - Blocking must be expressed ONLY in `blocking_questions`

- If deterministically impossible:
  - Stage A MUST enter ABORTED per Doc-06 rules

### 3.4 Deterministic Completion Criteria (Gate)

Idea Engine is considered compliant ONLY when:
- All Stage A required artifacts exist and are closed
- Approval record indicates APPROVE (Doc-03)
- No unresolved MUST-level ambiguity exists

---

## 4. Engine 2 — Documentation Refinement Engine Contract (Stage B)

### 4.1 Objective

Generate a Docs Pack that is sufficient for deterministic implementation, then iteratively refine it until gaps and contradictions are eliminated deterministically.

### 4.2 Inputs (Authoritative)

- Closed Stage A artifacts, especially the approved frozen spec (Doc-03)
- Governance contracts and repository standards (Doc-03/05/06/08/09)

### 4.3 Outputs (Required Artifacts)

The Documentation Refinement Engine MUST produce the Stage B outputs required by Doc-03, plus the following engine-bound artifacts (names and locations are governed by Doc-03 and Doc-05):

- `docs_gap_report` (deterministic, clause-addressable)
- `docs_coverage_matrix` (requirements coverage mapping)
- `spec_pack_manifest` (explicit consumption order)

### 4.4 Gap Definition (Deterministic)

A Docs Pack has a GAP if ANY of the following are true:

1) A MUST-level behavior required by Stage A is not explicitly specified in Stage B artifacts
2) Two artifacts contain contradictory MUST-level rules
3) An interface contract is incomplete (missing inputs/outputs/constraints)
4) A validation rule required by Doc-03 Stage B gates cannot be evaluated deterministically

### 4.5 Refinement Loop Rules (Hard)

Loop iteration is permitted ONLY when:
- A deterministic GAP is recorded (Doc-03)
- The next iteration scope is bounded to closing those gaps only
- No new scope is introduced

Loop MUST terminate ONLY when:
- `docs_gap_report` indicates ZERO MUST-level gaps
- `docs_coverage_matrix` indicates 100% MUST-level coverage
- No contradictions remain

If termination criteria cannot be met deterministically:
- Return to Stage A OR enter Human Interrupt per Doc-03 failure classification rules
- No speculation, no “best effort” completion

### 4.6 Completion Gate (Doc-03 Binding)

Stage B may be marked CLOSED ONLY under Doc-03 gates and after required Boundary Audit PASS (Doc-08).

---

## 5. Engine 3 — Code↔Docs Consistency & Verification Engine Contract (Stage C)

### 5.1 Objective

Implement code strictly from the finalized Docs Pack, and repeatedly enforce:

- Docs → Code traceability (1:1 clause mapping)
- Detection of undocumented code behavior
- Detection of missing required behavior
- Test evidence generation per local verification contracts

### 5.2 Inputs (Authoritative)

- Stage B finalized Docs Pack (as listed in `spec_pack_manifest`)
- Existing repository code (if present)
- Governance contracts (Doc-03/05/06/08/09)

### 5.3 Required Outputs (Engine-Bound Artifacts)

Stage C MUST produce, at minimum:

- `code_trace_matrix` (Docs clause → file path → symbol/section → coverage)
- `code_mismatch_report` (missing vs undocumented behavior, clause-addressable)
- `test_evidence` (commands + deterministic output references, per Doc-09 logging rules)

### 5.4 Deterministic Definitions

#### 5.4.1 Trace Coverage

A requirement is COVERED only if:
- A specific code location is identified (file + symbol/section)
- The mapping is clause-addressable
- The code behavior is explicitly present and matches the clause

If any mapping cannot be proven deterministically:
- It is NOT covered
- Stage C MUST stop and return to Stage B (Doc-03)

#### 5.4.2 Undocumented Code

Any code behavior that:
- Affects execution outcomes
- Alters state
- Produces artifacts
- Changes stage/progress handling

And cannot be mapped to a specific Stage B clause:
- Is forbidden
- Must appear in `code_mismatch_report` as undocumented behavior
- MUST trigger return to Stage B (Doc-03)

#### 5.4.3 Missing Required Behavior

Any MUST-level clause with no mapped code:
- Is a missing behavior
- Must appear in `code_mismatch_report`
- Stage C MUST implement it ONLY if the clause is explicit
- If clause is underspecified → return to Stage B (Doc-03)

### 5.5 Compliance Loop Rules (Hard)

Loop iteration is permitted ONLY while:
- Mismatches are being deterministically reduced
- No inference is required

Loop MUST terminate ONLY when:
- `code_mismatch_report` indicates ZERO unresolved mismatches
- `code_trace_matrix` indicates 100% MUST-level coverage
- Required tests PASS with evidence as per Doc-09

If these cannot be met due to spec insufficiency:
- Return to Stage B
No local workaround is permitted.

## 6. Verification Alignment (Stage D Boundary)

This document does NOT define Stage D verification artifacts beyond those already governed by Doc-09 and Doc-03.

It binds that:
- Stage D verification MUST be based on deterministic logs and artifacts
- Verification outputs have ZERO acceptance authority (Doc-03 / Doc-09)
- Boundary Audit PASS/FAIL is independent and non-overridable (Doc-08)

---

## 7. Human Interrupt Conditions (Binding)

Human Interrupt is permitted ONLY if:
- A selectable, contract-compliant fork exists, OR
- Mandatory external input is missing (credentials, non-derivable config), OR
- Retry limits are exceeded under Doc-04 and a fork exists

All blocking MUST be represented first in governed runtime authority artifacts and then mirrored in `progress/status.json` per Doc-06.

No cognitive engine, decision engine, or continuation gate may derive approval,
rejection,
resume,
or override authority from `progress/status.json`.

`progress/status.json` is reflection/output only.

No comfort questions, no preference selection prompts.

---

## 8. Non-Negotiable Rule

If any engine behavior in code or documentation contradicts this contract:
- Execution MUST halt (Fail-Closed)
- The owning stage MUST be re-entered per Doc-03
- No downstream continuation is permitted
