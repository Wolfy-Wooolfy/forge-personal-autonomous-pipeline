# 1. Authority & Scope

This document defines the authoritative governance model for executing
the SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM inside Forge.

This document:

- Defines module ordering
- Defines execution determinism
- Defines inter-module contracts
- Defines fail-closed behavior
- Defines decision escalation
- Defines immutability rules
- Defines runtime enforcement requirements

No module may execute outside this governance contract.

If conflict occurs between any module contract and this document,
THIS DOCUMENT PREVAILS.

---

# 2. Execution Determinism Law

Execution MUST be deterministic.

Given identical repository state:
- Same inputs
- Same file ordering
- Same configuration
- Same runtime version

The system MUST produce:
- Identical artifacts
- Identical reports
- Identical decisions
- Identical logs

Non-deterministic behaviors are strictly prohibited.

Examples of forbidden behavior:
- Random ordering
- Time-dependent logic without snapshot locking
- Non-seeded hashing
- External API calls without capture snapshot

---

# 3. Module Ordering Law

Modules MUST execute strictly in this order:

1. Intake
2. Audit
3. Trace
4. Gap
5. Design Exploration
6. Decision Gate
7. Backfill
8. Execute
9. Verify
10. Closure
11. Vision Compliance (executes only after Closure success)
12. AI System Alignment (terminal — executes only after Vision Compliance success)

No module may skip forward.
No module may execute out of order.
No parallel execution is permitted.

Conditional Module Activation Rule:

The following modules are conditional and execute ONLY when an
Execution Fork is detected:

- Design Exploration

If Gap analysis produces a deterministic execution path,
these modules MUST be skipped and execution proceeds directly to:

Decision Gate validation.

If exploration results in only one valid path,
Decision Gate MUST NOT request a decision and execution continues automatically.

---

Design Exploration Module Definition

Design Exploration is an analytical module executed
between Gap analysis and Decision Gate escalation.

Its purpose is to:

- Analyze structural or architectural proposals
- Compare deterministic alternative paths
- Generate structured option comparison artifacts

Design Exploration MUST NOT:

- modify repository files
- generate code
- modify governance documents
- advance stage progress
- bypass Decision Gate

Design Exploration is analysis-only.

Its artifacts serve as contextual inputs
for Decision Gate packet construction.

Governance References:

Fork detection and exploration behavior are governed by:

- docs/07_decisions/EXECUTION_FORK_DETECTION_RULES.md
- docs/03_pipeline/DESIGN_EXPLORATION_PROTOCOL.md

Decision creation and escalation remain governed by:

- docs/07_decisions/07_Decision_Logging_and_Change_Traceability_Specification.md
- docs/07_decisions/DECISION_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA.md

---

Verify Module Definition

Verify is a mandatory execution module that runs after Execute
and before Closure.

Its purpose is to:

- validate artifact completeness
- ensure audit has passed (audit.blocked = false)
- confirm pipeline integrity
- detect execution inconsistencies

Verify MUST NOT:

- modify repository files
- generate new code
- alter governance documents
- bypass Closure rules

Verify is a validation-only module.

Closure MUST NOT execute if Verify fails.

---

Vision Compliance Module Definition

Vision Compliance is a pre-terminal enforcement module that runs after Closure success.
It executes before AI System Alignment (module 12).

Its purpose is to:

- validate full vision runtime coverage
- confirm final release acceptance
- enforce Stage A through Stage D completion evidence
- confirm no open gaps remain after Closure

Vision Compliance MUST NOT:

- modify repository files
- generate new code
- alter governance documents
- bypass Closure rules
- reopen closed stages

Vision Compliance is a pre-terminal validation-only module.

Pipeline completion MUST NOT be considered final unless BOTH Vision Compliance AND AI System Alignment succeed.

---

# 3.1 AI System Alignment Module Definition

AI System Alignment (module 12) is the true terminal module of the pipeline.

**Task binding:** TASK-068: FULL SYSTEM ALIGNMENT WITH AI OS AND AI LAYER CONTRACTS
**Required previous module:** VISION_COMPLIANCE
**terminal_flag:** true

## Purpose

AI System Alignment enforces full alignment between:
- Forge Core (execution authority)
- AI Layer contracts (`docs/11_ai_layer/`)
- AI Operating System contracts (`docs/12_ai_os/`)
- Workspace Runtime behavior
- Conversation-to-execution boundary governance

## Activation Preconditions (Fail-Closed)

MUST NOT execute unless ALL are true:
- Vision Compliance completed with PASS
- `artifacts/tasks/TASK-067.execution.closure.md` exists
- No BLOCKED state active

## Required Outputs

- `artifacts/tasks/TASK-068.execution.closure.md`
- All intermediate stage artifacts listed in TASK-068 closure chain

## Terminal Behavior

Upon PASS → pipeline reaches COMPLETE (`next_allowed_step: "COMPLETE"`)
Upon FAIL → BLOCKED, human escalation required, no downstream module exists

## Governing Documents

- docs/11_ai_layer/ (full pack)
- docs/12_ai_os/00_AI_OS_MASTER_SPEC.md through 20_REQUIREMENT_DISCOVERY_LOOP.md
- docs/12_ai_os/19_AI_OS_RUNTIME_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md

---

# 4. Module Re-Entry Rule

A module may re-run only if:

- Repository state changed
- A Decision Gate approved re-entry
- A fail-closed state requires correction

Re-entry MUST invalidate downstream artifacts.

Example:
If Trace re-runs → Gap, Decision, Backfill, Execute, Closure must be invalidated.

---

# 5. Data Passing Contract

Each module MUST produce structured artifacts.

Artifacts are the ONLY allowed communication layer between modules.

Modules MAY NOT:
- Share in-memory state
- Depend on console logs
- Infer data outside artifacts

All artifacts MUST:

- Be schema-bound
- Be deterministic
- Be written before next module begins
- Be immutable once consumed downstream

---

# 6. Fail-Closed Law

If any ambiguity exists, the system MUST:

- Enter BLOCKED state
- Produce exactly ONE blocking question
- Halt execution

The system MUST NOT:
- Assume
- Infer missing intent
- Continue optimistically

BLOCKED state MUST be written into governed runtime authority artifacts, and MAY be mirrored into `progress/status.json` as reflection/output.

---

# 7. Decision Escalation Law

Decision Gate MUST activate when:

- Multiple valid corrective paths exist
- Architectural tradeoffs are detected
- Missing required authority input
- Risk of scope drift

Decision Packet MUST include:

- Context
- Options
- Risks
- Deterministic impact
- Required confirmation

Decision outcome MUST be logged immutably.

---

# 8. Stage Interaction Law

SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM operates INSIDE Forge.

It does NOT override stage governance.

If Stage contract conflicts with Module execution:

- Stage contract takes precedence
- System must escalate to Decision Gate

Stage transitions may occur only after Closure module success.

---

# 9. Emergency Halt Protocol

System MUST halt immediately if:

- Integrity verification fails
- Required artifact missing
- Status corruption detected
- Schema violation detected
- Runtime mismatch detected

Halt MUST produce:

- emergency_report.md
- explicit reason
- corrective recommendation

No silent recovery permitted.

---

# 10. Immutability & Drift Protection

Once Closure succeeds:

- All artifacts are immutable
- Hash snapshot must be regenerated
- Drift detection must be enabled

Any post-closure modification requires:

- Explicit new execution cycle
- New Decision record
- Artifact regeneration

---

# 11. Artifact Hierarchy Rule

Artifacts produced by modules MUST reside under:

artifacts/<module_name>/

Examples:

artifacts/intake/
artifacts/audit/
artifacts/trace/
artifacts/gap/
artifacts/exploration/
artifacts/decisions/
artifacts/backfill/
artifacts/execute/
artifacts/closure/

In addition, the following namespaces are permitted as IMMUTABLE-LEGACY
(GRANDFATHERED) for historical evidence only:

- artifacts/tasks/
- artifacts/stage_A/
- artifacts/stage_B/
- artifacts/stage_C/
- artifacts/stage_D/
- artifacts/reports/
- artifacts/release/

IMMUTABLE-LEGACY Rules:

- Legacy namespaces MAY exist and remain unchanged.
- Forge runtime MUST treat them as READ-ONLY.
- No module may write new artifacts into any IMMUTABLE-LEGACY namespace.
- Any attempt to write into IMMUTABLE-LEGACY is a CRITICAL violation and MUST halt execution.

---

### SYSTEM-GOVERNED Namespaces

The following namespaces are SYSTEM-GOVERNED and may be written to
ONLY by their designated system component:

| Namespace | Owner | Governing Document |
|---|---|---|
| artifacts/forge/ | forge_state_resolver only | DOC-31, SCHEMA-07 |
| artifacts/orchestration/ | orchestrator only | docs/10_runtime/10_Tech_Assumptions_and_Local_Runtime_Setup.md |
| artifacts/cognitive/ | cognitive_adapter only | DOC-46, DOC-05 §4.6 |
| artifacts/llm/ | cognitive_adapter only | DOC-64 §5 |
| artifacts/ai/ | AI Layer modules only | docs/11_ai_layer/04_AI_LAYER_ARTIFACTS.md |
| artifacts/coverage/ | Vision Compliance module only | DOC-15, DOC-16 |
| artifacts/verify/ | Boundary Audit layer only | DOC-08 §2.2.1, §2.2.2 |
| artifacts/archive/ | forge-reset-new-project.js only | DOC-54 §6 |
| artifacts/projects/ | AI OS project workspace components, plus Backfill/Execute ONLY for approved execution-package project deliverables | docs/12_ai_os/09_EXECUTION_HANDOFF_TO_FORGE.md, DOC-35, DOC-36 |
| artifacts/admission/ | Idea Structuring Layer only | DOC-01 §5 |

No other component may write to SYSTEM-GOVERNED namespaces.
Any violation is a CRITICAL fault and MUST halt execution.

---

No module may write outside its designated namespace.

---

# 12. Runtime Enforcement Clause

Forge runtime MUST:

- Enforce module ordering
- Enforce artifact existence before progression
- Enforce fail-closed state
- Prevent stage drift
- Prevent re-run without invalidation

Runtime enforcement is mandatory.
Soft warnings are not permitted.

---

# 13. SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM Activation Condition

System activates when:

- governed runtime authority artifacts resolve a valid deterministic entry state
- Or a new execution task is registered

Activation MUST:

- Lock repository snapshot
- Record execution start artifact
- Begin Intake module

---

# 14. Non-Compliance Consequence

If any module violates this governance:

- Execution is invalid
- Artifacts are considered corrupt
- Closure is forbidden
- System must halt

---

# 15. Governance Integrity Statement

This governance model ensures:

- Deterministic execution
- Zero silent drift
- Zero implicit assumption
- Full auditability
- Full traceability
- Reproducible builds

SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM is not a heuristic assistant.
It is a deterministic autonomous build engine.
