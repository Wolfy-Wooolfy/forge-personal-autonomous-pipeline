# Documentation Gap Detection & Refinement Loop Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-42
**Stage:** B
**Status:** BINDING – EXECUTION CONTRACT
**Applies To:** Stage B – Documentation Engine
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

## Supersession Notice

Artifact naming in this document reflects an earlier schema version.

In case of any conflict between artifact names or formats in this document and the current artifact schema, precedence is defined as follows:

1. 05_17_Artifact_Schema_Revision_v2.md
2. 05_Artifact_Schema_and_Repository_Layout_Standard.md

All artifact naming, formats, and closure definitions in newer specifications override any conflicting definitions in this document.

This document remains valid for process logic and conceptual flow only.

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines the deterministic rules governing:

- Documentation generation
- Cross-document consistency analysis
- Gap detection
- Iterative refinement
- Stage B closure conditions

Stage B MUST NOT close
until documentation is provably gap-free
under deterministic evaluation rules.

This contract has execution authority.

---

## 2. Stage B Scope

Stage B operates exclusively on:

```

docs/*

```

Stage B MUST:

1. Generate full documentation pack from the approved Idea Final Spec.
2. Analyze all documents collectively.
3. Detect structural gaps, contradictions, and undefined references.
4. Emit a deterministic Gap Report artifact.
5. Iterate refinement until closure criteria are satisfied.

Stage B MUST NOT:
- Modify Stage A artifacts.
- Execute code.
- Advance to Stage C without formal closure.

---

## 3. Authoritative Inputs

Stage B accepts ONLY:

- `artifacts/stage_A/idea_final_spec.json`

No other narrative or external input is permitted.

If this artifact is missing:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 4. Mandatory Artifacts

Stage B MUST produce the following artifacts:

### 4.1 Documentation Pack
Location:
```

docs/*

```

All required documentation must exist and match repository structure.

---

### 4.2 Documentation Gap Report

Path:
```

artifacts/stage_B/docs_gap_report.json

```

Rules:
- JSON ONLY
- Deterministic
- Non-narrative
- Immutable once written
- No inferred commentary

Minimum required fields:

- timestamp_utc
- evaluated_documents (array)
- total_documents_count
- detected_gaps_count
- contradictions_count
- undefined_references_count
- missing_required_documents (array)
- structural_inconsistencies (array)
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

If this artifact is missing → Stage B FAILS.

---

## 5. Definition of a Gap (Deterministic)

A gap is defined as ANY of the following:

1. A referenced document does not exist.
2. A declared contract has no matching artifact definition.
3. An artifact type exists without a producing stage contract.
4. A stage references behavior not defined in pipeline contracts.
5. Duplicate responsibility between documents.
6. Circular dependency between documentation units.
7. Undefined terms that affect execution authority.
8. Missing mandatory documentation file required by repository structure.

No subjective evaluation is permitted.

---

## 6. Gap Detection Rules

Gap detection MUST:

- Parse all documents under `docs/`
- Build a deterministic reference map
- Validate cross-references
- Validate stage authority mappings
- Validate artifact ownership

Gap detection MUST NOT:
- Interpret intent
- Suggest improvements
- Modify documents

Gap detection is analysis only.

---

## 7. Refinement Loop

If `docs_gap_report.json` result = "FAIL":

Stage B MUST:

1. Identify the structural source of each gap.
2. Modify ONLY the affected documentation files.
3. Regenerate the full gap report.
4. Repeat until:

```

detected_gaps_count = 0
contradictions_count = 0
undefined_references_count = 0
missing_required_documents = []
structural_inconsistencies = []

```

No partial closure is allowed.

---

## 8. Iteration Control

The refinement loop is bounded by:

- Autonomy Policy retry limits
- Local Execution Loop Guard (Build & Verify Playbook)

If deterministic closure cannot be achieved:
→ Execution MUST Abort.

No downgrade of detection rules is allowed.

---

## 9. Stage B Closure Criteria

Stage B may close ONLY if:

- `docs_gap_report.json` result = "PASS"
- No mandatory document missing
- No cross-reference unresolved
- No duplicate stage authority exists
- All required contracts are defined

Closure MUST produce:

```

artifacts/stage_B/documentation_refinement_closure.md

```

This closure artifact MUST reference:

- docs_gap_report.json
- evaluated document count
- timestamp

Closure artifact has ZERO narrative authority.
It exists only to bind Stage B completion.

---

## 10. Prohibited Behaviors

Stage B MUST NOT:

- Close with known gaps
- Suppress gap detection
- Convert FAIL into PASS
- Ignore missing references
- Modify Stage A artifacts
- Advance to Stage C without PASS

Any violation → SYSTEM FAILURE.

---

## 11. Fail-Closed Enforcement

If gap detection:

- Cannot execute deterministically
- Produces inconsistent counts
- Encounters ambiguous structure

Then:

- Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED
- Human Interrupt REQUIRED

No fallback allowed.

---

## 12. Authority Clarification

Gap detection does NOT:

- Evaluate documentation quality
- Judge completeness subjectively
- Approve architectural decisions

It ONLY enforces structural integrity and contract completeness.

Acceptance authority remains exclusively in Stage D.
