# Final Acceptance & Release Gate Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-44
**Stage:** D
**Status:** BINDING – EXECUTION CONTRACT
**Applies To:** Stage D – Final Verification & Acceptance
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

## 1. Purpose

Stage D defines the ONLY authoritative acceptance gate
for a Forge pipeline execution lifecycle.

Stage D determines:

- Whether the project matches its documented contracts
- Whether execution integrity has been preserved
- Whether all prior stages were closed properly
- Whether release authority may be granted

Verification does not equal acceptance.

Stage D grants acceptance authority.

---

## 2. Authoritative Inputs

Stage D accepts ONLY:

- Stage A closure artifacts
- Stage B closure artifacts
- Stage C closure artifacts
- All required verification artifacts
- All required audit logs

If any required stage closure artifact is missing:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

No partial acceptance permitted.

---

## 3. Acceptance Validation Scope

Stage D MUST validate:

1. Stage A compliance
2. Stage B structural completeness
3. Stage C trace completeness
4. Verification integrity
5. Audit compliance
6. Retry and rollback traceability
7. Absence of unresolved BLOCKED state
8. Absence of active Execution Abort

Stage D MUST NOT:

- Re-evaluate quality
- Redesign architecture
- Suggest improvements
- Introduce new requirements

It validates contractual fulfillment only.

---

## 4. Acceptance Verification Artifact

Stage D MUST produce:

```

artifacts/stage_D/final_acceptance_report.json

```

Rules:
- JSON ONLY
- Deterministic
- Non-narrative
- Immutable once written

Minimum required fields:

- timestamp_utc
- stage_A_closed (boolean)
- stage_B_closed (boolean)
- stage_C_closed (boolean)
- verification_passed (boolean)
- audit_failures_present (boolean)
- unresolved_blocked_state (boolean)
- execution_abort_present (boolean)
- final_result ("ACCEPTED" | "REJECTED")

If any boolean invalidates acceptance:
→ final_result MUST be "REJECTED"

Partial acceptance forbidden.

---

## 5. Release Gate Rules

Release authority MAY be granted ONLY if:

- final_result = "ACCEPTED"
- No active boundary audit FAIL
- No unresolved retry attempts
- No rollback in incomplete state
- No local execution loop detected
- No verification failure recorded

If any condition fails:
→ Release MUST NOT occur.

---

## 6. Rejection Handling

If final_result = "REJECTED":

Stage D MUST:

1. Halt progression.
2. Preserve all artifacts.
3. Prevent release.
4. Emit rejection classification in acceptance report.
5. Require deterministic re-entry at appropriate stage.

Rejection is not advisory.
It is binding.

---

## 7. Stage D Closure Artifact

If ACCEPTED:

Stage D MUST produce:

```

artifacts/stage_D/release_gate_closure.md

```

This artifact MUST reference:

- final_acceptance_report.json
- verification_report.json
- code_stage_closure.md
- documentation_refinement_closure.md
- idea_stage_closure.md

Closure artifact MUST NOT:

- Contain narrative approval
- Add commentary
- Override JSON acceptance result

It is a binding pointer artifact only.

---

## 8. Fail-Closed Enforcement

If acceptance validation:

- Cannot be executed deterministically
- Encounters ambiguous state
- Detects conflicting artifacts

→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

If deterministic validation is impossible:
→ Execution MUST Abort.

No manual override permitted.

---

## 9. Authority Clarification

Stage D is the ONLY authority that may:

- Declare lifecycle completion
- Grant release permission
- Confirm contract fulfillment

All prior stages prepare evidence.
Only Stage D decides acceptance.

Verification PASS does not imply acceptance.

Acceptance authority is exclusive.

---

## 10. Prohibited Behaviors

Stage D MUST NOT:

- Accept with known failures
- Ignore audit violations
- Override boundary failures
- Skip closure artifact validation
- Advance without all stage closures

Any violation → SYSTEM FAILURE.

---

## 11. Definition of Acceptance

A project is ACCEPTED ONLY if:

- All contracts satisfied
- All stages closed
- All verification passed
- No boundary violations
- No unresolved execution state
- No missing artifacts
- Deterministic traceability proven

Only then may lifecycle be marked complete.
