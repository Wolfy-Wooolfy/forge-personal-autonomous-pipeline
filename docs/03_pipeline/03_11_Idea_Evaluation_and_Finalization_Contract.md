# 📄 Document — Idea Evaluation & Finalization Contract

## Supersession Notice

Artifact naming in this document reflects an earlier schema version.

In case of any conflict between artifact names or formats in this document and the current artifact schema, precedence is defined as follows:

1. 05_17_Artifact_Schema_Revision_v2.md
2. 05_Artifact_Schema_and_Repository_Layout_Standard.md

All artifact naming, formats, and closure definitions in newer specifications override any conflicting definitions in this document.

This document remains valid for process logic and conceptual flow only.

> **Precondition Notice:**  
> This contract operates only after a valid Admission-Ready Project Definition
> has been produced per DOC-01 (Idea Structuring & Admission Layer Contract).
>
> This contract does not replace the Admission Layer
> and must not be used as an entry point into the pipeline.

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-11
**Status:** BINDING — EXECUTION CONTRACT
**Applies To:** Stage A — Idea Engine
**Enforcement Level:** Fail-Closed
**Authority Type:** Deterministic Stage Contract

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the deterministic contract governing:

* Raw Idea Intake
* Idea Evaluation
* Structured Refinement
* Final Idea Specification
* Approval Gate behavior

This contract transforms Stage A from:

> Free-form idea processing

into:

> A bounded, iterative, contract-governed Idea Engine

No Idea may progress to Stage B unless this contract is fully satisfied.

---

## 2. Scope of Stage A

Stage A is responsible ONLY for:

1. Accepting raw idea input
2. Structurally reconstructing it
3. Evaluating feasibility and structural completeness
4. Detecting ambiguity
5. Producing a Final Idea Specification artifact
6. Requesting approval ONLY if deterministically required

Stage A MUST NOT:

* Generate documentation packs
* Generate implementation details
* Assume missing intent
* Expand scope
* Optimize beyond explicit idea content

---

## 3. Inputs

Stage A accepts exactly ONE authoritative input artifact:

```
artifacts/stage_A/raw_idea.json
```

This artifact MUST contain:

* idea_id
* timestamp_utc
* raw_content (string)
* declared_scope (string)
* constraints (array)
* assumptions (array)

If any required field is missing → EXECUTION MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 4. Structural Reconstruction Phase

Raw content MUST be transformed into a structured artifact:

```
artifacts/stage_A/idea_structured.json
```

This artifact MUST contain:

* problem_statement
* target_users
* core_value_proposition
* explicit_constraints
* explicit_non_goals
* measurable_success_criteria
* system_boundaries
* unresolved_questions (array)

Rules:

* All narrative must be converted into field-addressable structure
* No raw free-text paragraphs allowed
* No inference beyond raw input
* No scope expansion

If structural reconstruction cannot be deterministic → FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 5. Idea Evaluation Phase

Evaluation is NOT quality scoring.

Evaluation MUST check only:

* Structural completeness
* Internal contradiction
* Ambiguity detection
* Missing mandatory fields
* Scope leakage
* Implicit assumption detection

Output artifact:

```
artifacts/stage_A/idea_evaluation_report.json
```

Fields:

* evaluation_id
* completeness_status ("COMPLETE" | "INCOMPLETE")
* contradiction_detected (boolean)
* scope_leak_detected (boolean)
* ambiguity_detected (boolean)
* missing_fields (array)
* blocking_questions (array)
* result ("PASS" | "BLOCKED")

Rules:

If:

* missing_fields NOT empty
* ambiguity_detected = true
* contradiction_detected = true

Then:

* result MUST be "BLOCKED"
* blocking_questions MUST contain exactly ONE minimal structural question
* Execution MUST trigger Human Interrupt (Doc-04 compliant)

If no structural issues → result = "PASS"

---

## 6. Final Idea Specification

If evaluation result = PASS:

Stage A MUST generate:

```
artifacts/stage_A/idea_final_spec.json
```

This artifact MUST contain:

* idea_id
* normalized_problem_statement
* validated_scope
* validated_constraints
* validated_non_goals
* validated_success_metrics
* approved_boundaries
* ready_for_documentation (boolean = true)

Rules:

* No new information may be introduced
* No optimization allowed
* Must reflect structured artifact only
* Must remove unresolved questions
* Must be deterministic

If unresolved_questions exist → FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 7. Approval Gate Logic

Approval is required ONLY if:

* raw idea declared "requires explicit confirmation"
* OR structural ambiguity required clarification
* OR scope refinement materially altered meaning

If approval required:

* Execution MUST enter BLOCKED
* A Human Interrupt MUST be triggered
* Approval MUST be logged as Decision artifact (Doc-07)

If approval NOT required:

* Stage A may close autonomously
* Stage transition to Stage B permitted

---

## 8. Exit Criteria (Hard)

Stage A may close ONLY if ALL are true:

* idea_structured.json exists
* idea_evaluation_report.json result = PASS
* idea_final_spec.json exists
* No unresolved_questions remain
* No blocking_questions remain
* Boundary Audit PASS recorded
* Verification PASS recorded

If ANY condition fails → Stage A MUST NOT close.

---

## 9. Prohibited Behaviors

Stage A MUST NOT:

* Score idea attractiveness
* Suggest improvements
* Optimize business model
* Add features
* Expand scope
* Introduce speculative architecture
* Convert idea into documentation format
* Generate implementation-level content

Violation → Boundary Audit FAIL.

---

## 10. Fail-Closed Enforcement

If at any point:

* Determinism cannot be proven
* Structural mapping is ambiguous
* Evaluation cannot produce binary outcome

Then:

* Execution MUST halt
* Human Interrupt required
* No continuation allowed

---

## 11. Authority Separation

Artifacts produced in Stage A:

Have ZERO implementation authority.

They:

* Cannot generate code
* Cannot modify documentation
* Cannot alter pipeline state directly

They serve ONLY as input to Stage B under contract.

---

## 12. Definition of Stage A Completion

Stage A is complete ONLY when:

* idea_final_spec.json exists
* Evaluation PASS
* All audits PASS
* No blocking state
* Stage transition performed by orchestrator

Any other condition → Stage A incomplete.
