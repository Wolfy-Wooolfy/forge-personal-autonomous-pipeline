# Documentation Gap Analyzer Validator Contract

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-30  
**Stage:** B  
**Status:** MANDATORY – ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT  
**Scope:** Stage A → Stage B Specification Integrity  
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed  

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines the deterministic enforcement rules
that guarantee documentation completeness,
internal consistency,
and zero MUST-level gaps
before Stage B may close.

Stage B MUST NOT advance
unless documentation gap analysis passes deterministically.

This validator enforces:

- No missing requirements
- No contradictions
- No underspecified MUST-level behavior
- No scope expansion beyond Stage A

No subjective evaluation allowed.

---

## 2. Authoritative Inputs

Gap Analyzer operates ONLY on:

- artifacts/stage_A/idea_final_spec.md
- artifacts/stage_A/task_plan.md
- artifacts/stage_A/validated_assumptions.md
- artifacts/stage_B/specifications.md
- artifacts/stage_B/data_schemas.md
- artifacts/stage_B/interface_contracts.md
- artifacts/stage_B/validation_rules.md
- artifacts/stage_B/edge_cases.md
- artifacts/stage_B/docs_coverage_matrix.md
- artifacts/stage_B/docs_gap_report.md

If any required artifact is missing:
→ GAP VALIDATION FAIL

---

## 3. MUST-Level Coverage Rule (Hard)

Every MUST-level requirement defined in:

artifacts/stage_A/idea_final_spec.md

MUST:

- Appear in docs_coverage_matrix.md
- Be marked COVERED
- Map to an explicit section in Stage B docs

If any MUST requirement:

- Is marked MISSING
- Is marked CONFLICT
- Has no explicit mapping

→ FAIL CLOSED

Partial coverage is forbidden.

---

## 4. Underspecification Rule

For every MUST-level behavior:

Documentation MUST define:

- Inputs
- Outputs
- Deterministic behavior
- Validation conditions
- Edge case behavior (if applicable)

If behavior exists without:

- Deterministic outcome definition
- Explicit constraint definition

→ CLASSIFY AS UNDERSPECIFIED  
→ FAIL CLOSED

---

## 5. Contradiction Detection Rule

Gap Analyzer MUST detect:

- Conflicting definitions between documents
- Inconsistent schema fields
- Conflicting interface contracts
- Duplicate responsibility definitions

If contradiction detected:

→ CLASSIFY AS CONTRADICTION  
→ FAIL CLOSED

No prioritization allowed.
No document hierarchy override allowed.

---

## 6. Scope Expansion Prohibition

Stage B MUST NOT introduce:

- New features not present in Stage A
- Additional constraints not frozen in Stage A
- Speculative safeguards
- Anticipatory behavior

If any documentation section cannot be traced
back to Stage A artifacts:

→ CLASSIFY AS SCOPE_EXPANSION  
→ FAIL CLOSED

---

## 7. Assumption Validation Rule

All assumptions in:

artifacts/stage_A/validated_assumptions.md

MUST be either:

- Explicitly implemented in Stage B specs, OR
- Explicitly resolved

If unresolved assumptions remain:

→ FAIL CLOSED

---

## 8. Gap Classification

If a gap is detected,
it MUST be classified as ONE of:

- MISSING_REQUIREMENT
- UNDERSPECIFIED_BEHAVIOR
- CONTRADICTION
- SCOPE_EXPANSION
- UNRESOLVED_ASSUMPTION
- INVALID_SCHEMA_REFERENCE

No narrative allowed.

---

## 9. Gap Validation Output Artifact

Path:

verify/unit/docs_gap_validation_report.json

Rules:

- JSON ONLY
- Overwritten per run
- Deterministic fields only
- Non-narrative

Minimum required fields:

- timestamp_utc
- total_must_requirements
- covered_requirements
- missing_requirements
- contradictions_detected
- underspecified_behaviors
- scope_expansions
- unresolved_assumptions
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

PASS only if:

- missing_requirements = 0
- contradictions_detected = 0
- underspecified_behaviors = 0
- scope_expansions = 0
- unresolved_assumptions = 0

Any non-zero → FAIL CLOSED

---

## 10. Iteration Enforcement Rule

If result = FAIL:

Stage B MUST:

- Remain in Documentation Refinement Loop
- Regenerate documentation
- Re-run Gap Analyzer

Stage B MUST NOT:

- Advance to Stage C
- Downgrade requirement severity
- Reclassify MUST as SHOULD

If deterministic resolution impossible:

→ RETURN TO STAGE A  
OR  
→ HUMAN INTERRUPT (if selectable fork exists)

---

## 11. Enforcement Authority

Gap Analyzer:

- Has ZERO authority to modify documents
- Has ZERO retry authority
- Has ZERO stage advancement authority

It is a pure gate.

Stage B MAY close only if:

- docs_gap_validation_report.json result = PASS

---

## 12. Fail-Closed Guarantee

If Gap Analyzer:

- Cannot parse documents
- Detects ambiguous requirement references
- Encounters missing coverage matrix
- Detects structural inconsistency

→ FAIL CLOSED  
→ Stage B MUST halt  
→ No downstream transition allowed  

---

## 13. Definition of Documentation Completeness

Documentation completeness exists ONLY if:

- All MUST-level requirements covered
- No contradictions exist
- No underspecified behaviors remain
- No scope expansion detected
- No unresolved assumptions remain

Only then may Stage B close.
