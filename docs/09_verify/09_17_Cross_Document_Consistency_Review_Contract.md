# Cross-Document Consistency Review Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-47
**Status:** MANDATORY – GOVERNANCE INTEGRITY GATE
**Scope:** All Execution-Bound Documents
**Applies To:** Stage Contracts, Artifact Specs, Verification Playbooks
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines the mandatory cross-document consistency review
required before:

- Introducing new execution validators
- Introducing new enforcement layers
- Advancing lifecycle governance maturity

Its purpose is to guarantee:

- No authority conflicts exist
- No duplicated execution rules exist
- No contradictory stage behavior exists
- No artifact schema overlaps exist
- No implicit authority transfer exists

This review is structural, not narrative.

---

## 2. Review Scope (Mandatory Target Set)

The review MUST include:

- docs/03_pipeline/*
- docs/05_artifacts/*
- docs/09_verify/*
- Forge Boundary Audit Rules (DOC-08)
- Build & Verify Playbook

If any execution-bound document is omitted:
→ Review is invalid
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED

---

## 3. Consistency Dimensions

Each document MUST be evaluated against the following dimensions:

---

### 3.1 Authority Collision Detection

Check for:

- Multiple documents granting the same authority
- Verification granting stage authority
- Artifacts advancing stage implicitly
- Audit overlapping verification logic

If detected:
→ Review FAIL

---

### 3.2 Closure Rule Consistency

Check that:

- Stage closure rules match artifact definitions
- Closure artifacts required by stage contracts
  are defined in Artifact Specification
- Closure conditions are identical across documents

Mismatch → FAIL CLOSED

---

### 3.3 Schema Duplication Detection

If a schema appears in:

- More than one document
- In paraphrased form
- With field variations

→ FAIL CLOSED

Schemas must be declared in ONE authoritative location only.

---

### 3.4 Loop Termination Alignment

Verify that:

- Iteration rules in Stage A, B, C
  match loop guard rules in Build & Verify
- Loop abort classification aligns with Boundary Audit
- No loop can bypass stage re-entry rules

Mismatch → FAIL

---

### 3.5 Authority Layer Separation Check

Confirm strict separation of:

- Cognitive Layer
- Pipeline Stage Authority
- Verification Gate
- Boundary Audit
- Acceptance Authority

Any cross-layer leakage → FAIL CLOSED

---

### 3.6 Artifact Path Alignment

Ensure:

- All artifact paths referenced in stage contracts
  exist in Artifact Specification
- No undefined artifact is required
- No artifact defined without stage reference

Undefined or orphan artifacts → FAIL

---

## 4. Review Output Artifact

The review MUST produce exactly one artifact:

Path:
verify/unit/cross_document_consistency_report.json

Rules:
- JSON ONLY
- Overwritten per run
- Non-narrative
- Deterministic fields only

Minimum required fields:

- timestamp_utc
- documents_scanned (array)
- authority_conflicts_detected (integer)
- schema_duplications_detected (integer)
- closure_mismatches_detected (integer)
- loop_alignment_issues (integer)
- layer_separation_violations (integer)
- orphan_artifacts_detected (integer)
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

If result = FAIL:
→ Execution MUST halt
→ No new validator may be introduced

---

## 5. Consistency PASS Criteria

Review is PASS only if:

- All conflict counters = 0
- No undocumented authority exists
- No duplicated schema exists
- No stage ambiguity exists

---

## 6. Review Authority

This review:

- Has ZERO stage advancement authority
- Has ZERO acceptance authority
- Exists only as governance integrity gate

It MUST NOT:
- Modify documents
- Rewrite artifacts
- Suggest improvements
- Propose fixes

It may only:
- PASS
- FAIL

---

## 7. Enforcement Rule

No new validator
(no Trace Validator,
no Spec Consistency Engine,
no Code Intelligence Engine)
may be introduced
until this contract reports PASS.

Violation → SYSTEM FAILURE.
