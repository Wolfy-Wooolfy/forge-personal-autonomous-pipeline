# Code-to-Spec Trace Validator Contract

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-29  
**Stage:** C  
**Status:** MANDATORY – ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT  
**Scope:** Specification ↔ Code Compliance  
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed  

---

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines the mandatory enforcement rules
that guarantee 1:1 traceability between:

- Stage B documentation (Specifications)
- Stage C source code artifacts

Stage C MUST NOT advance
unless trace compliance is proven deterministically.

No inferred mapping allowed.
No partial coverage allowed.

---

## 2. Authoritative Inputs

Trace Validator operates ONLY on:

- artifacts/stage_B/specifications.md
- artifacts/stage_B/data_schemas.md
- artifacts/stage_B/interface_contracts.md
- artifacts/stage_B/validation_rules.md
- artifacts/stage_B/edge_cases.md
- artifacts/stage_C/code_trace_matrix.md
- Source code under /code/src/*
- Tests under /code/tests/*

If any required input is missing:
→ TRACE VALIDATION FAIL

---

## 3. One-to-One Mapping Rule (Hard)

Every MUST-level requirement in Stage B MUST:

- Appear exactly once in code_trace_matrix.md
- Reference exactly one file path
- Reference exactly one symbol or section
- Contain justification

Every code artifact MUST:

- Map to at least one explicit requirement
- Not introduce undocumented behavior

Unmapped code → FAIL CLOSED  
Unmapped requirement → FAIL CLOSED  

No exceptions.

---

## 4. Trace Matrix Structure Enforcement

Trace matrix MUST:

- Be Markdown
- Use deterministic clause IDs
- Use exact requirement references
- Not paraphrase requirements
- Not summarize intent

Trace matrix MUST NOT:

- Interpret specifications
- Merge multiple requirements
- Omit edge cases
- Include speculative coverage

---

## 5. Edge Case Enforcement

All edge cases defined in:

artifacts/stage_B/edge_cases.md

MUST be:

- Implemented explicitly
- Mapped in trace matrix
- Covered by at least one test

Missing edge case coverage → FAIL

---

## 6. Test Alignment Rule

For every MUST-level requirement:

At least one test MUST exist that:

- References the clause ID
- Verifies expected deterministic behavior

If a requirement has no test:
→ TRACE FAIL

If a test exists without requirement:
→ TRACE FAIL

---

## 7. Mismatch Classification

If mismatch detected,
validator MUST classify as ONE of:

- MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION
- UNDOCUMENTED_BEHAVIOR
- INTERFACE_CONFLICT
- SCHEMA_MISMATCH
- EDGE_CASE_MISSING
- TEST_COVERAGE_MISSING

No narrative allowed.

---

## 8. Trace Validation Output Artifact

Path:

verify/unit/trace_validation_report.json

Rules:

- JSON ONLY
- Overwritten per run
- Non-narrative
- Deterministic fields only

Minimum required fields:

- timestamp_utc
- total_requirements
- mapped_requirements
- unmapped_requirements
- undocumented_code_sections
- edge_cases_missing
- test_coverage_missing
- mismatches_detected
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

PASS only if:

- unmapped_requirements = 0
- undocumented_code_sections = 0
- edge_cases_missing = 0
- test_coverage_missing = 0
- mismatches_detected = 0

Any non-zero → FAIL CLOSED

---

## 9. Enforcement Authority

Trace Validator:

- Has ZERO code modification authority
- Has ZERO retry authority
- Has ZERO stage advancement authority

It is a pure gate.

Stage C MAY close only if:

- trace_validation_report.json result = PASS
- verification_report.json result = PASS

---

## 10. Fail-Closed Guarantee

If trace validation:

- Cannot parse matrix
- Detects ambiguous clause mapping
- Encounters missing clause IDs
- Detects dynamic behavior not spec-bound

→ TRACE FAIL  
→ Stage C MUST halt  
→ No downstream transition allowed  

---

## 11. Prohibited Behaviors

Stage C MUST NOT:

- Adjust code to fit validator after FAIL
  without deterministic re-entry
- Remove trace entries to silence mismatch
- Merge requirements to fake coverage
- Create placeholder tests

Any attempt to bypass trace integrity
constitutes a system violation.

---

## 12. Definition of Trace Compliance

Trace compliance exists ONLY if:

- Every requirement implemented
- Every implementation justified
- Every edge case handled
- Every test aligned
- No undocumented behavior present

Only then may Stage C claim compliance.
