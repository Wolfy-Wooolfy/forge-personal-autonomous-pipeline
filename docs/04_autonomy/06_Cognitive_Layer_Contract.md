# 📄 Cognitive_Layer_Contract
**Document ID:** DOC-12  
**Status:** EXECUTION-BOUND  
**Scope:** Task Layer Governance & Loop Enforcement  
**Applies To:** Stage A/B/C/D Execution  
**Enforcement Level:** HARD (Fail-Closed)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally defines the Cognitive Layer.

The Cognitive Layer is the execution intelligence layer
operating under Stage authority.

It transforms:
- Specifications
- Contracts
- Documentation
into deterministic artifacts.

These artifacts remain non-authoritative
until validated under the owning stage gate and artifact authority rules.

It does NOT hold governance authority.

---

## 2. Definition

The Cognitive Layer consists of:

- Task Handlers
- Validators
- Analyzers
- Gap Detectors
- Trace Generators
- Verification Runners

Each component MUST:

- Be explicitly declared
- Be stage-bound
- Produce schema-compliant artifacts
- Respect Artifact Authority Hierarchy (DOC-11)

---

## 3. Task Definition (Formal)

A Task is a deterministic execution unit that:

1. Belongs to exactly one Stage
2. Declares its input authority source
3. Declares expected output artifacts
4. Declares closure condition
5. Declares rollback condition

A Task without explicit stage binding is INVALID.

---

## 4. Task Structure Requirements

Every Task MUST declare:

- Task ID (unique)
- Stage Binding (A/B/C/D)
- Contract Clauses Satisfied
- Artifact Outputs (path + schema type)
- Preconditions
- Stop Conditions
- Escalation Conditions

If any of these are missing:
→ Task execution MUST NOT begin.

---

## 5. Loop Binding Rule

The Cognitive Layer enforces three loops:

### Loop 1 — Idea Refinement
Stage A + Stage B

Outputs:
- Evaluated Idea
- Final Spec
- Deterministic evaluation report

Closure Condition:
- Approved Final Spec artifact exists

---

### Loop 2 — Documentation Refinement
Stage B

Outputs:
- Complete documentation pack
- Gap report (zero MUST-level gaps)
- Coverage matrix (100% MUST coverage)

Closure Condition:
- Gap count = 0 (MUST-level)
- Coverage = 100%

---

### Loop 3 — Code Implementation & Trace Enforcement
Stage C

Outputs:
- Trace Matrix (Docs → Code 1:1)
- Mismatch Report (zero unresolved MUST mismatches)
- Verification Evidence
- Stage C closure artifact

Closure Condition:
- Zero unresolved MUST mismatches
- Trace coverage = 100%
- Local verification pass

---

## 6. Determinism Rule

Cognitive outputs must be:

- Schema-bound
- Machine-verifiable
- Non-narrative where defined by contract
- Repeatable under same inputs

If nondeterminism is detected:
→ Execution enters BLOCKED state.

---

### 6.1 Cognitive Engine Availability Rule (Hard)

If a Task requires Cognitive Engine generation
and Cognitive Engine is:

- Disabled
- Misconfigured
- Unreachable
- Failing deterministically

Then:

- The Task MUST NOT begin
- No partial artifacts may be generated
- Execution MUST enter BLOCKED state
- No stage transition is permitted

Cognitive Engine unavailability
is treated as an execution constraint,
not a Decision,
unless multiple valid fallback paths exist.

---

## 7. Escalation Rules

The Cognitive Layer may escalate ONLY if:

- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Required external input is missing
- Deterministic resolution is impossible

Escalation must:
- Raise exactly one blocking question
- Halt execution
- Not advance progress

---

## 8. Prohibited Behavior

The Cognitive Layer MUST NOT:

- Improve quality beyond contract
- Infer undocumented requirements
- Override Stage contracts
- Close stages without artifact proof
- Treat LLM output as authoritative truth

LLM outputs are candidates until artifact-bound.

---

## 9. Task Closure Supremacy

A Task is considered CLOSED only when:

- All declared artifacts exist
- Artifacts pass schema validation
- No unresolved MUST-level violations remain

Logs do not equal closure.
Execution time does not equal closure.

Only artifacts equal closure.

---

## 10. Compliance Requirement

This document is EXECUTION-BOUND.

Any Cognitive execution not compliant:

→ Invalidates Stage progress
→ Triggers governance violation
→ Requires remediation

---

## 11. External Cognitive Engine Declaration

Forge does not implement an intrinsic reasoning engine.

All generative capabilities described in this contract
may be fulfilled by an external Cognitive Engine
as defined in:

DOC-CE-01 — Cognitive Engine Interface Contract.

This document governs the internal behavioral rules of the Cognitive Layer.

The external engine:

- Has no authority
- Cannot alter system state
- Cannot advance stages
- Cannot create valid artifacts independently

All authority remains governed by Forge contracts.

This section exists to prevent architectural ambiguity
regarding the origin of generative reasoning.
