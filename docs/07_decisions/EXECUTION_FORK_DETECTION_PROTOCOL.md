# Execution Fork Detection Protocol

**Document ID:** DOC-57
**Status:** BINDING – EXECUTION FORK DETECTION AUTHORITY
**Scope:** Fork Detection Across Lifecycle Stages
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the deterministic rules used to detect
a **Selectable Execution Fork** inside the Forge autonomous pipeline.

The protocol ensures that:

- forks are detected consistently
- forks are not invented artificially
- deterministic execution continues when possible
- decision escalation occurs only when strictly required

This document defines **when a fork exists** and **when it does not**.

---

# 2. Definition of Execution Fork

An **Execution Fork** exists ONLY when all of the following conditions are true:

1. Multiple execution paths exist.
2. Each path is contract-compliant.
3. Each path produces materially different downstream artifacts or behavior.
4. Deterministic rules cannot select exactly one path.
5. Execution cannot continue without choosing one path.

If ANY condition is not satisfied:

→ A fork MUST NOT be declared.

---

# 3. Fork Detection Preconditions

Fork detection may occur ONLY when:

- execution has reached a decision-relevant step
- all required artifacts are present
- evaluation context is deterministic
- execution state is not BLOCKED
- execution state is not ABORTED

If these conditions are not met:

- fork detection MUST NOT begin
- execution must follow the appropriate failure path

---

# 4. Fork Detection Sources

Execution forks may originate from the following sources:

### 4.1 Architectural Alternatives

Multiple valid structural approaches exist to achieve
the same contract objective.

Example:

- Two valid system architectures
- Two valid module boundaries

---

### 4.2 Implementation Strategy Variants

Multiple implementation strategies satisfy the same specification.

Example:

- Different algorithmic implementations
- Different dependency injection approaches

---

### 4.3 Structural Tradeoffs

Two or more contract-compliant approaches exist
with different structural consequences.

Example:

- Simplicity vs extensibility tradeoffs
- Modular vs integrated implementation

---

### 4.4 Policy-Allowed Optional Behavior

Contracts explicitly allow multiple behaviors
without mandating one.

Example:

- Optional caching strategies
- Optional optimization mechanisms

---

# 5. Non-Fork Conditions (Hard Rule)

The following situations MUST NOT be treated as forks:

- Validation failures
- Missing required inputs
- Schema violations
- Deterministic rule application
- Retry execution paths
- Error handling
- Execution Abort conditions
- Policy enforcement
- Boundary violations

These conditions MUST follow their own contracts.

They MUST NOT trigger fork detection.

---

# 6. Fork Detection Algorithm

The system MUST apply the following deterministic logic:

1. Identify all candidate execution paths.
2. Validate each path against declared constraints.
3. Disqualify any path violating constraints.
4. Determine whether more than one valid path remains.

Outcomes:

- If zero valid paths remain → Execution Abort.
- If exactly one valid path remains → Continue execution.
- If more than one valid path remains → Fork detected.

---

# 7. Fork Resolution Pipeline

Once a fork is detected, the system MUST follow this sequence:

```

Fork Detection
↓
Design Exploration
↓
Option Evaluation
↓
Recommendation Artifact
↓
Decision Gate

```

Execution MUST NOT bypass these stages.

Direct escalation without analysis is forbidden.

---

# 8. Fork Classification

Forks must be classified to maintain traceability.

Allowed fork classifications:

- ARCH — Architectural fork
- EXEC — Execution strategy fork
- DATA — Data structure fork
- STRUCT — Structural organization fork
- POLICY — Contract-allowed optional behavior

Classification MUST be recorded in the fork analysis artifact.

---

# 9. Fork Traceability Requirement

Every detected fork MUST produce a **Fork Analysis Artifact**
containing:

- fork identifier
- triggering artifact
- lifecycle stage
- detected alternatives
- constraint validation results
- fork classification

This artifact ensures that forks remain auditable.

---

# 10. Forbidden Fork Generation (Hard)

The system MUST NOT generate forks artificially.

Artificial forks include:

- narrative reinterpretation of a single path
- stylistic differences presented as alternatives
- options outside declared scope
- alternatives violating constraints
- alternatives derived from implicit assumptions

If artificial fork generation is detected:

→ Execution MUST halt.

---

# 11. Deterministic Continuation Rule

If a deterministic rule exists that selects exactly one path:

- a fork MUST NOT be declared
- execution MUST proceed automatically

Decision escalation is permitted ONLY when deterministic selection is impossible.

---

# 12. Interaction with Option Evaluation

Fork detection is a prerequisite for option evaluation.

Option Evaluation Framework (DOC-49)
may begin ONLY after a valid fork is confirmed.

If no fork exists:

- option evaluation MUST NOT begin
- execution MUST continue normally.

---

# 13. Interaction with Decision Governance

Decision logging is permitted ONLY after fork detection.

Decision Logging Specification governs:

- decision artifact creation
- decision authority
- decision traceability

If no fork exists:

→ a Decision MUST NOT be logged.

---

# 14. Fork Exhaustion Rule

If exploration and evaluation eliminate all alternatives:

- the fork is considered non-resolvable
- execution MUST enter Execution Abort
- no decision escalation is permitted

Execution authority is exhausted.

---

# 15. Deterministic Detection Guarantee

Fork detection is considered deterministic when:

- candidate paths are explicitly defined
- constraints are explicit
- artifact references are available
- path validation is rule-driven

If determinism cannot be proven:

→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 16. Summary

The Execution Fork Detection Protocol ensures that:

- forks are detected only when truly present
- deterministic execution is preserved whenever possible
- option evaluation occurs only when necessary
- decision escalation remains controlled

Core rule:

No Fork → No Decision.

Fork → Exploration → Evaluation → Decision.

This guarantees that Forge remains deterministic,
auditable,
and governance-compliant.
