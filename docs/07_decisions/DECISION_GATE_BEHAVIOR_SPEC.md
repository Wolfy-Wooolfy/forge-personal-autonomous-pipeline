# Decision Gate Behavior Specification

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-26  
**Status:** EXECUTION-BOUND  
**Scope:** Behavioral Specification for Decision Gate Module  
**Applies To:** Forge Cognitive Layer  
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the behavior of the Decision Gate module.

Decision Gate is responsible for controlling
all non-deterministic decision points in Forge.

Its responsibility is to ensure that:

- execution remains deterministic
- forks are detected early
- exploration is triggered when needed
- decision authority is respected.

Decision Gate is therefore the boundary
between deterministic execution
and design exploration.

---

# 2. Architectural Position

Decision Gate exists inside the Forge pipeline
between artifact processing stages.

Typical flow:

Artifact Produced  
↓  
Decision Gate Validation  
↓  
Execution Continues

or

Artifact Produced  
↓  
Decision Gate Detects Fork  
↓  
Design Exploration Protocol  
↓  
Human Decision  
↓  
Execution Continues

---

# 3. Core Responsibilities

Decision Gate has five core responsibilities.

1. Detect Execution Forks  
2. Trigger Design Exploration  
3. Enforce Decision Governance  
4. Block Unauthorized Decisions  
5. Resume Deterministic Execution after Decision

---

# 4. Decision Gate Inputs

Decision Gate evaluates the following inputs:

- Current lifecycle stage
- Triggering artifact
- Scope Contract
- Objective Contract
- Execution constraints
- Architecture rules
- Pipeline rules

These inputs define whether execution
can continue deterministically.

---

# 5. Fork Detection

Decision Gate must apply the rules defined in:

EXECUTION_FORK_DETECTION_RULES.md

If a fork condition exists:

Execution must pause immediately.

Execution must not continue until the fork is resolved.

---

# 6. Exploration Trigger

When a fork is detected,
Decision Gate must initiate:

Design Exploration Protocol.

Exploration must produce:

- option definitions
- constraint validation
- evaluation results
- recommendation artifact.

Execution must remain paused during exploration.

---

# 7. Decision Escalation

If exploration produces multiple valid options:

Decision Gate must escalate the decision
to human authority.

Forge must never choose between valid options.

Only human authority may select the final path.

---

# 8. Accepted Decision Inputs

Decision Gate accepts decisions only if they are:

- explicit
- documented
- traceable
- contract-compliant.

Accepted decision artifacts must include:

- selected option
- justification
- decision authority
- decision timestamp.

---

# 9. Decision Validation

Before execution resumes,
Decision Gate must validate the decision.

Validation checks include:

- scope compliance
- objective alignment
- constraint compliance
- architecture integrity.

If any validation fails:

Execution must halt.

---

# 10. Resuming Execution

After a valid decision:

Execution may resume.

Decision Gate records:

- decision artifact reference
- affected pipeline stage
- chosen execution path.

Execution then proceeds deterministically.

---

# 11. Decision Logging

All decisions must be logged.

Decision records must include:

- triggering artifact
- detected fork
- evaluated options
- recommendation artifact
- final decision.

This ensures full traceability.

---

# 12. Forbidden Behavior

Decision Gate must never:

- invent new options
- expand project scope
- alter objectives
- bypass exploration
- silently choose between valid options.

Such actions violate governance rules.

---

# 13. Fail-Closed Enforcement

If Decision Gate cannot determine
whether execution is deterministic:

Execution must halt.

The system must escalate for clarification.

Forge must never continue
with uncertainty at decision boundaries.

---

# 14. Interaction with Other Modules

Decision Gate interacts with:

Intake Engine  
Audit Engine  
Trace Engine  
Gap Engine  
Backfill Engine  
Execute Engine

However it does not modify artifacts.

It only controls execution flow.

---

# 15. Traceability Requirement

Every Decision Gate action must remain traceable.

Traceability must link:

artifact → fork → exploration → decision → execution

This guarantees that every decision
remains auditable.

---

# 16. Summary

Decision Gate ensures that Forge:

- never hides decisions
- never guesses implementation paths
- never violates scope governance.

It transforms Forge into a system that is:

deterministic in execution  
structured in exploration  
controlled in decision making.
