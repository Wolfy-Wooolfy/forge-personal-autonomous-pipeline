# Execution Fork Detection Rules

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-28  
**Status:** BINDING – EXECUTION CONTROL  
**Scope:** Detection of Decision Forks During Execution  
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C  
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the rules used by Forge
to detect when deterministic execution
can no longer continue along a single path.

When such a condition is detected,
Forge must transition from execution mode
to Design Exploration Mode.

This ensures that the system:

- does not guess implementation choices
- does not silently choose between alternatives
- does not violate governance contracts.

---

# 2. Definition of an Execution Fork

An Execution Fork exists when:

Multiple valid execution paths exist
and the system cannot deterministically
select one path using existing authority.

A Fork means:

There is more than one correct path,
but selecting between them requires judgment
outside deterministic rules.

---

# 3. When a Fork Must Be Declared

Forge MUST declare a Fork when any of the following conditions occur.

---

## 3.1 Multiple Valid Implementations

Two or more implementations exist
that satisfy:

- Scope Contract
- Objective Contract
- Technical Constraints

and none is objectively dominant.

Example:

Two architectures both satisfy requirements
but differ in complexity or maintainability.

---

## 3.2 Missing Deterministic Rule

Execution requires selecting a value
or structure that is not defined by:

- documentation
- artifact schema
- system rules.

Example:

Choosing between two module structures
not defined by the architecture contract.

---

## 3.3 Conflicting Objectives

Multiple objectives exist
and satisfying one degrades another.

Example:

Lower complexity vs higher flexibility.

When tradeoffs exist
without priority authority,
a fork must be declared.

---

## 3.4 Architecture-Level Change

An option alters:

- system architecture
- module boundaries
- artifact flow
- pipeline behavior

Such decisions must never be taken autonomously.

---

## 3.5 External Strategy Impact

A decision affects:

- product strategy
- project scope
- governance boundaries

Such decisions require human authority.

---

# 4. When a Fork Must NOT Be Declared

Forge MUST NOT declare a Fork when:

---

## 4.1 Deterministic Rule Exists

If documentation already defines the rule,
Forge must execute it.

Example:

File location rules
artifact naming
schema definitions.

---

## 4.2 Option Violates Constraints

If an alternative violates:

- scope
- objective
- constraints

it must be discarded.

Invalid options never create forks.

---

## 4.3 Implementation Detail Only

If the choice does not affect:

- architecture
- pipeline flow
- artifacts

it may be resolved locally.

Example:

internal variable naming
code formatting.

---

# 5. Fork Detection Workflow

When a Fork condition is detected,
Forge must perform the following steps.

---

## Step 1 – Pause Execution

Deterministic execution halts.

No further artifacts are generated.

---

## Step 2 – Initiate Design Exploration

Forge begins structured exploration
according to:

Design Exploration Protocol.

---

## Step 3 – Generate Alternatives

Valid options are defined
within contract boundaries.

---

## Step 4 – Evaluate Options

Options are evaluated using:

Option Evaluation Framework.

---

## Step 5 – Produce Recommendation

Forge produces a Recommendation Artifact
summarizing:

- options
- evaluation
- tradeoffs
- recommended path.

---

## Step 6 – Escalate Decision

Human authority selects
the final execution path.

---

# 6. Fork Artifact Requirements

When a fork occurs,
Forge must generate a Fork Record.

This artifact must include:

- triggering artifact
- stage location
- detected alternatives
- constraint validation
- evaluation results
- recommendation.

This ensures full traceability.

---

# 7. Fail-Closed Rule

If Forge detects a possible fork
but cannot determine whether it qualifies:

Execution must halt
until the ambiguity is resolved.

Forge must never:

- assume a decision
- guess an implementation
- silently continue.

---

# 8. Traceability Requirement

Every fork must remain traceable to:

- triggering artifact
- governing contracts
- evaluation framework
- final decision artifact.

This ensures the decision lifecycle
remains auditable.

---

# 9. Summary

Execution Fork Detection guarantees that:

- execution never makes hidden decisions
- alternatives are explored safely
- evaluation remains objective-driven
- human authority retains control
  over strategic choices.

Forge therefore remains:

deterministic in execution  
analytical in exploration  
governed in decision making.
