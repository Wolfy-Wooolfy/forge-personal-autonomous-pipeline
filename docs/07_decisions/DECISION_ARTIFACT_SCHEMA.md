This document defines the original decision artifact framework for Forge.

Decision artifacts record the final resolution
of an execution fork after design exploration.

They ensure that every strategic choice
made during the project lifecycle
remains traceable, auditable,
and reproducible.

---

# 2. Artifact Location

Decision artifacts must be stored under:

artifacts/decisions/

Each decision must be saved as:

DECISION-XXX.<decision-name>.md

Example:

DECISION-001.execution-architecture.md

---

# 3. Decision Lifecycle

A decision artifact is generated after:

1. Execution Fork Detection
2. Design Exploration
3. Option Evaluation
4. Human Authority Selection

Only then may the decision artifact be created.

---

# 4. Mandatory Fields

Every decision artifact must contain
the following sections.

---

## Decision ID

Unique identifier of the decision.

Example:

DECISION-004

---

## Triggering Artifact

The artifact that caused the fork.

Example:

TASK-056.stageA.operating-modes-contract.md

---

## Stage Location

The pipeline stage where the decision occurred.

Example:

Stage A
Stage B
Stage C

---

## Fork Description

Clear description of the decision fork.

Example:

Multiple module architecture designs exist
that satisfy the system constraints.

---

## Options Evaluated

All valid options must be listed.

Each option must include:

- description
- architecture impact
- constraints compliance.

Example:

Option A – Modular layered architecture
Option B – Flat module architecture

---

## Evaluation Summary

Objective evaluation of all options.

Evaluation must consider:

- objective alignment
- constraint compliance
- architectural integrity
- long-term maintainability.

Evaluation must remain neutral.

---

## Recommendation

Forge may provide a recommendation.

Recommendation must include:

- rationale
- benefits
- possible risks.

Forge must never impose a decision.

---

## Final Decision

The option selected by human authority.

Example:

Selected Option: Option A

---

## Decision Authority

Identity of the decision maker.

Example:

System Architect
Project Owner

---

## Decision Timestamp

Date and time of the decision.

---

## Impact Scope

Defines what parts of the system
are affected by the decision.

Example:

- architecture
- module structure
- artifact flow
- pipeline behavior.

---

## Implementation Directive

Defines what execution must do next.

Example:

Implement layered architecture
for Forge module structure.

---

# 5. Decision Integrity Rules

Decision artifacts must satisfy:

- traceability
- completeness
- clarity
- authority validation.

Incomplete decision artifacts are invalid.

---

# 6. Fail-Closed Rule

If a fork occurs but
no decision artifact exists:

Execution must remain halted.

Forge must not continue
without a recorded decision.

---

# 7. Traceability Requirements

Decision artifacts must link to:

- triggering artifact
- exploration results
- evaluation framework
- implementation artifacts.

This ensures full lifecycle traceability.

---

# 8. Example Decision Artifact

Example path:

artifacts/decisions/DECISION-002.module-boundaries.md

Example structure:

Decision ID: DECISION-002

Triggering Artifact: TASK-057.stageA.intake-classification-contract.md

Stage Location: Stage A

Fork Description:
Multiple module boundary structures possible.

Options Evaluated:
Option A – Dedicated module per pipeline phase
Option B – Combined modules

Evaluation Summary:
Option A offers higher clarity and traceability.

Recommendation:
Option A recommended for long-term maintainability.

Final Decision:
Option A selected.

Decision Authority:
Project Owner

Decision Timestamp:
2026-03-12

Impact Scope:
Module architecture

Implementation Directive:
Create separate modules per pipeline stage.

---

# 9. Summary

Decision artifacts ensure that:

- every strategic choice is recorded
- execution paths remain traceable
- governance remains enforceable.

Forge therefore maintains a
complete decision history
for every project lifecycle.
