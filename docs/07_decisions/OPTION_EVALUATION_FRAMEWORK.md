# Option Evaluation Framework

**Document ID:** DOC-49
**Status:** BINDING – DETERMINISTIC OPTION EVALUATION
**Scope:** Alternative Evaluation During Design Exploration
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the deterministic framework
used to evaluate multiple valid alternatives
when a selectable execution fork exists.

The framework ensures that:

- option comparison is structured
- evaluation remains objective-driven
- constraint violations are detected
- decision escalation occurs only when required

This framework does NOT grant authority to:

- expand scope
- introduce new alternatives
- modify success criteria
- select a final execution path autonomously
  when multiple valid paths remain.

Its role is strictly analytical.

---

# 2. Evaluation Preconditions

Option evaluation may begin ONLY if all of the following exist:

1. A valid execution fork exists.
2. All candidate options are contract-compliant.
3. Objective authority is defined.
4. Constraints are explicitly declared.
5. Evaluation occurs inside a valid lifecycle stage.

If any condition is missing:

- Evaluation MUST NOT begin.
- Execution MUST escalate.

---

# 3. Option Definition Requirements

Every option must satisfy the following:

- It must remain inside accepted scope.
- It must be contract-compliant.
- It must represent a distinct execution path.
- It must produce materially different downstream artifacts.

Options MUST be mutually exclusive.

Options MUST NOT:

- partially overlap
- describe the same implementation under different wording
- exist only as narrative variation.

---

# 4. Evaluation Dimensions

All options are evaluated across the following dimensions:

1. Constraint Compliance
2. Objective Alignment
3. Structural Complexity
4. Deterministic Behavior
5. Maintainability Impact

These dimensions ensure
that option comparison remains consistent.

---

# 5. Constraint Validation (Hard Gate)

Constraint validation occurs before scoring.

If an option violates ANY declared constraint:

- The option is immediately disqualified.
- The option MUST NOT proceed to scoring.

Constraint validation is binary:

- PASS
- FAIL

No partial compliance exists.

---

# 6. Objective Alignment Evaluation

Options are evaluated against:

- Primary Objective
- Secondary Objectives (if defined)

Primary Objective dominates evaluation.

If an option violates the primary objective
while another option satisfies it:

- the violating option is disqualified.

Secondary objectives may only break ties
between otherwise valid options.

---

# 7. Structural Complexity Assessment

Structural complexity measures:

- architectural depth
- dependency count
- integration surface
- cross-module impact

Lower structural complexity is preferred
unless it violates the primary objective.

Complexity must be derived
from artifacts, not narrative claims.

---

# 8. Deterministic Behavior Assessment

Each option must be evaluated for its impact on:

- execution determinism
- rule-driven execution
- traceability
- artifact closure stability

Any option that introduces
non-deterministic execution behavior
is automatically disqualified.

---

# 9. Maintainability Impact

Maintainability measures:

- clarity of implementation
- traceability to documentation
- long-term modification safety

Maintainability must be evaluated
through artifact structure
rather than subjective interpretation.

---

# 10. Evaluation Result Types

Option evaluation produces one of three outcomes.

---

## 10.1 Single Dominant Option

If one option satisfies all constraints
and dominates evaluation across objectives:

- the fork is considered resolved
- execution may continue deterministically
- no Decision artifact is required.

---

## 10.2 Multiple Valid Options

If multiple options remain valid after evaluation:

- exploration MUST produce a Recommendation Artifact
- execution MUST escalate to human decision authority.

The system MUST NOT select an option autonomously.

---

## 10.3 No Valid Options

If all options fail constraint validation:

- the exploration process MUST terminate
- the fork is considered non-resolvable
- execution MUST enter Execution Abort state

No escalation is permitted.

Reason:

If no contract-compliant option exists,
then no selectable execution fork exists.

Without a valid fork:

- no Decision artifact may be created
- no human selection can resolve the condition

Execution authority is therefore exhausted.

Execution Abort MUST be recorded
according to the Progress Tracking & Status Report Contract.

---

# 11. Recommendation Artifact Structure

Recommendation artifacts MUST contain:

- evaluated option list
- constraint validation results
- objective comparison table
- detected tradeoffs
- recommended option

Recommendation artifacts remain analytical only.

They carry ZERO execution authority.

---

# 12. Evaluation Determinism Requirement

Evaluation is deterministic only when:

- option definitions are explicit
- constraints are explicit
- objective authority is defined
- evaluation artifacts are recorded.

If determinism cannot be proven:

→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 13. Evaluation Traceability

Every evaluation MUST reference:

- the triggering artifact
- the lifecycle stage
- the evaluated alternatives
- the constraint validation results
- the recommendation artifact (if generated)

This ensures that evaluation remains auditable.

---

# 14. Evaluation Authority Limits

The evaluation framework MUST NOT:

- select the final execution path
- override Decision authority
- introduce new alternatives
- modify scope or intent.

Decision authority remains strictly human.

---

# 15. Summary

The Option Evaluation Framework ensures that:

- alternatives are compared deterministically
- constraint violations are eliminated early
- objective alignment drives comparison
- decision escalation occurs only when necessary.

This framework guarantees that
option evaluation remains analytical,
auditable,
and bounded by system governance.
