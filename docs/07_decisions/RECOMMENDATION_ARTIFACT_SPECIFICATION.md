# Design Exploration Protocol

**Document ID:** DOC-53
**Status:** BINDING – DESIGN EXPLORATION EXECUTION PROTOCOL
**Scope:** Exploration of Alternatives Prior to Option Evaluation
**Applies To:** Stage A, Stage B, Stage C
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the deterministic protocol
used to analyze and structure alternative execution paths
after a valid Execution Fork has been detected.

Design Exploration exists to:

- analyze the detected fork
- enumerate valid alternatives
- eliminate structurally invalid proposals
- prepare inputs for Option Evaluation

This stage occurs BEFORE Option Evaluation
and BEFORE any Decision escalation.

---

# 2. Exploration Preconditions

Design Exploration may begin ONLY if:

1. A valid Execution Fork has been detected.
2. Fork Detection artifact exists.
3. Lifecycle stage is active.
4. No BLOCKED state exists.
5. Execution has not entered ABORTED state.

If any condition fails:

→ Exploration MUST NOT begin.

---

# 3. Exploration Inputs

Exploration requires the following inputs:

- fork detection artifact
- triggering artifact
- lifecycle stage identifier
- applicable contracts and specifications

Exploration MUST NOT rely on:

- narrative interpretation
- unstated assumptions
- undocumented requirements.

---

# 4. Exploration Objectives

Design Exploration performs the following tasks:

1. Identify candidate execution paths.
2. Normalize candidate descriptions.
3. Eliminate structurally invalid alternatives.
4. Prepare explicit option definitions.

The goal is to produce a deterministic set of candidate options.

---

# 5. Candidate Option Identification

Candidate options may originate from:

- architectural alternatives
- implementation strategies
- structural variations
- policy-permitted optional behaviors

Each candidate MUST represent
a materially different execution path.

Narrative variation MUST NOT produce separate options.

---

# 6. Option Normalization

Candidate options MUST be normalized so that:

- each option describes one execution path
- option boundaries are explicit
- option scope is clear
- option artifacts are predictable

Normalization ensures comparability during evaluation.

---

# 7. Structural Validity Screening

Each candidate option MUST be screened for:

- contract compliance
- scope preservation
- artifact traceability
- deterministic behavior compatibility

Options violating any rule MUST be eliminated.

Invalid options MUST NOT proceed to evaluation.

---

# 8. Exploration Outputs

Design Exploration MUST produce the following artifacts.

---

## 8.1 proposal_analysis.json

Contains structured analysis of the detected fork.

Example structure:

```

{
"fork_id": "",
"triggering_artifact": "",
"stage": "",
"analysis_summary": ""
}

```

---

## 8.2 option_matrix.json

Contains normalized candidate options.

Example structure:

```

{
"fork_id": "",
"options": [
{
"option_id": "",
"description": "",
"expected_artifacts": []
}
]
}

```

---

## 8.3 exploration_report.json

Provides deterministic record of exploration process.

Example structure:

```

{
"fork_id": "",
"candidate_options_detected": 0,
"options_eliminated": [],
"options_remaining": []
}

```

---

# 9. Exploration Outcomes

Exploration may produce three outcomes.

---

## 9.1 Single Valid Option

If exploration leaves exactly one valid option:

- fork is resolved
- execution may continue
- Option Evaluation is not required.

---

## 9.2 Multiple Valid Options

If more than one option remains:

- Option Evaluation MUST begin.

---

## 9.3 No Valid Options

If exploration eliminates all options:

- execution MUST enter Execution Abort.

No escalation is permitted.

---

# 10. Exploration Determinism Requirement

Exploration is deterministic only when:

- candidate options are explicitly defined
- elimination rules are contract-driven
- artifacts record exploration results

If determinism cannot be proven:

→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 11. Exploration Authority Limits

Design Exploration MUST NOT:

- select a final execution path
- override evaluation results
- modify project scope
- introduce undocumented requirements

Exploration is analytical only.

Execution authority remains outside this protocol.

---

# 12. Interaction with Option Evaluation

Option Evaluation begins ONLY when:

- exploration produced multiple valid options
- option_matrix.json exists
- exploration_report.json exists

Option Evaluation consumes exploration artifacts.

---

# 13. Traceability Requirement

Exploration artifacts MUST reference:

- fork identifier
- triggering artifact
- lifecycle stage
- candidate options

This ensures that exploration remains auditable.

---

# 14. Fail-Closed Rule

If exploration artifacts cannot be generated
or candidate options cannot be validated:

→ execution MUST halt.

---

# 15. Summary

Design Exploration ensures that:

- forks are analyzed deterministically
- candidate options are clearly defined
- invalid options are eliminated early
- evaluation receives structured inputs

This protocol prevents premature decisions
and ensures that alternative analysis
remains structured and auditable.
