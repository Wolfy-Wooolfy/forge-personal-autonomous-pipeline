# Project Objective Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-39  
**Project:** Forge  
**Document Type:** Binding Objective Authority Definition  
**Status:** EXECUTION-BOUND  
**Applies To:** Stage A Exploration, Alternative Evaluation, Decision Escalation

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the **objective authority**
that governs how Forge evaluates multiple valid paths
during early-stage execution.

Its purpose is to:

- Prevent arbitrary optimization
- Prevent subjective improvement attempts
- Provide deterministic evaluation criteria
- Allow bounded comparison of alternatives
- Ensure recommendation artifacts are objective-driven

This document does **NOT** grant authority to:

- Expand scope
- Modify success criteria
- Override stage governance
- Replace human decision authority

Its sole purpose is to define
**how alternatives are evaluated** when more than one valid path exists.

---

# 2. Objective Authority Principle

Forge is allowed to analyze and compare alternatives
ONLY when the task includes explicit objective authority.

Objective authority defines:

- What outcome the system is trying to optimize
- Which tradeoffs are acceptable
- Which constraints must never be violated
- How conflicting design options should be evaluated

Without objective authority,
alternative comparison is forbidden.

---

# 3. Mandatory Objective Structure

Every project entering the pipeline MUST declare
an explicit objective structure.

The objective structure MUST include the following fields.

---

## 3.1 Primary Objective (Required)

The **Primary Objective** defines the single most important
outcome that the system should optimize for.

Examples:

- Minimize system complexity
- Maximize determinism
- Minimize runtime dependencies
- Maximize maintainability
- Maximize reliability under failure

The primary objective MUST be:

- Explicit
- Singular
- Non-ambiguous

If multiple priorities exist,
they MUST be defined as Secondary Objectives.

---

## 3.2 Secondary Objectives (Optional)

Secondary objectives define additional desirable outcomes
that should be considered only after the primary objective
is satisfied.

Examples:

- Reduce code size
- Improve documentation clarity
- Reduce cognitive complexity
- Improve runtime performance

Secondary objectives MUST NOT override
the primary objective.

---

## 3.3 Non-Negotiable Constraints (Required)

These constraints represent boundaries
that cannot be violated under any circumstance.

Examples:

- Fail-Closed behavior
- Deterministic execution
- No undocumented behavior
- No raw text processing
- No implicit authority

Violation of a constraint automatically disqualifies
an evaluated alternative.

---

## 3.4 Tradeoff Priority Order (Required if conflicts exist)

When two alternatives satisfy the constraints
but optimize different aspects,
the system MUST use the declared tradeoff order
to evaluate them.

Example:

Priority Order:

1. Determinism
2. Simplicity
3. Runtime performance

In this example:

If one option improves performance
but reduces determinism,
it MUST be rejected.

---

# 4. Objective Authority Scope

Objective authority governs ONLY:

- evaluation of alternatives
- recommendation generation
- escalation preparation

Objective authority MUST NOT:

- introduce new features
- refine scope
- reinterpret intent
- add undocumented behavior
- change success criteria

If achieving the objective requires scope expansion,
the system MUST trigger a **New Task**.

---

# 5. Allowed Evaluation Activities

When objective authority exists,
Forge MAY perform the following activities:

- compare architectural alternatives
- compare implementation paths
- analyze structural complexity
- analyze long-term maintainability
- analyze deterministic behavior impact
- produce structured comparison artifacts

These activities are classified as:

**Design Exploration**

Design Exploration is allowed ONLY before Scope Freeze.

---

# 6. Forbidden Evaluation Behavior

Evaluation MUST NOT:

- introduce new design paths not already implied by scope
- reinterpret the project intent
- add new functional behaviors
- introduce undocumented interfaces
- silently modify the accepted architecture

Evaluation is analysis-only.

Implementation authority remains governed
by the pipeline stages.

---

# 7. Recommendation Artifacts

When multiple valid alternatives exist,
Forge MAY generate a recommendation artifact.

The artifact MUST include:

- evaluated alternatives
- objective comparison table
- constraint validation results
- detected tradeoffs
- recommended path

Recommendation artifacts have:

**ZERO execution authority**

They exist solely for human decision escalation.

---

# 8. Decision Escalation Rule

If multiple alternatives remain valid
after evaluation:

1. Forge MUST NOT select an option autonomously
2. Forge MUST produce a recommendation artifact
3. Forge MUST escalate to human authority
4. Execution MUST pause until decision resolution

Autonomous selection is forbidden
when more than one valid path exists.

---

# 9. Relationship with Scope Freeze

Objective authority operates **only before Scope Freeze**.

After Scope Freeze:

- Objectives cannot be reinterpreted
- Evaluation cannot introduce new options
- Improvement proposals are forbidden
- Only approved paths may be executed

If a new objective appears after freeze,
the system MUST trigger a **New Task**.

---

# 10. Interaction with Other Contracts

This document is subordinate to the following:

- Scope & Success Contract (DOC-02)
- Pipeline Stages Specification (DOC-03)
- Decision Logging & Change Traceability Specification
- Progress Tracking & Status Report Contract

If any conflict occurs:

Priority order:

1. Scope & Success Contract
2. Stage Specification
3. Decision Logging Specification
4. This Objective Contract

---

# 11. Deterministic Enforcement Rule

If any of the following occurs:

- objective structure missing
- primary objective undefined
- constraint set incomplete
- tradeoff priority ambiguous

then:

Forge MUST NOT evaluate alternatives.

Execution MUST escalate
per the Autonomy Policy.

---

# 12. Objective Integrity Requirement

Objective authority exists only when:

- the objective structure is complete
- constraints are explicit
- priorities are deterministic
- the objective is documented before Scope Freeze

If objective integrity cannot be proven,
evaluation authority does not exist.

---

# 13. Objective Immutability

Once Scope Freeze occurs:

- objective authority becomes immutable
- priorities cannot change
- constraints cannot change
- new objectives cannot be introduced

Attempting to modify objectives
after Scope Freeze
constitutes a **Scope Violation**.

---

# 14. Summary

This document establishes that:

- Forge is NOT allowed to optimize freely
- Forge is NOT allowed to invent improvements
- Forge is allowed to **evaluate alternatives**
  ONLY when objective authority exists
- Human authority remains required
  when multiple valid paths remain

The purpose of this contract
is to ensure that exploration remains
**controlled, deterministic, and bounded by intent**.
