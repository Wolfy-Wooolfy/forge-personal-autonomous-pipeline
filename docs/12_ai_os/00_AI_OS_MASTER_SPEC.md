# Forge AI Operating System Layer

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the full operating-system layer above Forge Core.

Forge Core remains the deterministic execution and verification engine.
The AI Operating System Layer is the human-facing, project-facing, and decision-facing layer that enables normal users to interact with the system in natural language, discuss ideas, iterate on requirements, approve or reject options, build documentation, and then hand approved execution packets to Forge.

The purpose of this layer is to transform Forge from a strict execution pipeline into a complete project operating environment that can:

* converse naturally with non-technical users in Arabic or English
* understand ambiguous project ideas and refine them over multiple turns
* analyze feasibility, business value, implementation options, and risks
* build structured project documentation through iterative review loops
* manage one or more projects with isolated state and artifacts
* escalate real decisions to the user when multiple valid paths exist
* hand approved work to Forge Core for execution
* review outputs until delivery is complete

This layer does not replace Forge. It surrounds Forge and governs how users reach execution.

---

## 2. Primary System Principle

The overall system is composed of three major layers:

### 2.1 Human Interaction Layer

This is the user-facing interface.
It handles:

* chat interaction
* project selection
* pending decisions
* progress visibility
* document review
* execution status visibility

It does not own final execution authority.

### 2.2 AI Operating System Layer

This is the reasoning, planning, discussion, and project management layer.
It handles:

* natural language understanding
* project intent resolution
* clarification loops
* idea discussion
* option comparison
* recommendation generation
* documentation creation and refinement
* project state management
* decision preparation
* execution handoff preparation

### 2.3 Forge Core Layer

This is the execution layer.
It handles:

* deterministic execution
* file operations
* execution artifacts
* verification
* closure
* governed execution state

The AI Operating System Layer may think, discuss, propose, and organize.
Forge Core executes.

---

## 3. User Promise

From the perspective of a normal user, the system should behave like a smart project partner.

A user should be able to:

* speak normally in Arabic or English
* describe an idea without technical language
* ask whether the idea is feasible
* ask whether it can generate profit
* ask for market or business reasoning
* ask for alternative ways to implement the idea
* accept some ideas and reject others
* ask for redrafts of project documents any number of times
* ask the system to build a project from idea to delivery
* ask the system to review an existing project and suggest improvements
* ask the system to work on multiple projects while keeping each project independent

The system should feel natural in conversation while remaining highly structured internally.

---

## 4. Supported User Types

### 4.1 Non-Technical User

Characteristics:

* does not understand code
* speaks in plain language
* may not know product terminology
* prefers direct recommendations
* prefers simple explanations

System behavior:

* explain with minimal jargon
* convert complexity into choices
* provide clear recommendations and reasons
* avoid forcing technical decisions when not necessary

### 4.2 Technical User

Characteristics:

* understands architecture and engineering choices
* wants more detailed tradeoffs
* may review technical documents closely

System behavior:

* show deeper technical detail
* expose implementation differences explicitly
* allow lower-level option inspection

### 4.3 Executive / Project Owner

Characteristics:

* focuses on value, cost, time, risk, and outcome
* wants clear progress visibility
* wants decisions framed in business language

System behavior:

* summarize status clearly
* highlight tradeoffs in business terms
* escalate only meaningful decisions

---

## 5. Interaction Modes

The operating system must support three primary modes.

### 5.1 Discussion Mode

Purpose:

* idea exploration
* feasibility discussion
* business reasoning
* clarification
* open-ended conversation

No execution is permitted in this mode.

### 5.2 Planning Mode

Purpose:

* convert ideas into structured plans
* define scope
* compare options
* create documentation
* review and refine documentation

No Forge execution is permitted until approved planning outputs exist.

### 5.3 Execution Mode

Purpose:

* convert approved planning outputs into execution-ready packets
* send work to Forge Core
* monitor execution
* verify outputs
* deliver results

Execution Mode may only begin after planning approval conditions are satisfied.

## 8. Project Object Model

Every project must be represented as a structured project object.

Minimum required fields:

* `project_id`
* `project_name`
* `project_type`
* `project_mode`
* `project_status`
* `primary_language`
* `user_goal`
* `business_goal`

* `FIX`
* `ENHANCEMENT`

### 8.2 Project Mode Values

Examples:

* `NEW_BUILD`
* `REVIEW_EXISTING`
* `EXTEND_EXISTING`
* `REPAIR`

---

## 9. Project Lifecycle States

Each project must move through explicit states.

Recommended lifecycle:

* `DISCOVERY`
* `DISCUSSION`
* `PLANNING`
* `OPTION_DECISION_PENDING`
* `DOCS_DRAFTING`
* `DOCS_REVIEW`
* `DOCS_APPROVED`
* `EXECUTION_READY`
* `EXECUTING`
* `VERIFYING`
* `DELIVERY_READY`
* `DELIVERED`
* `BLOCKED`

The system must not move into `EXECUTION_READY` unless documentation and required decisions are approved.

---

## 10. Conversation Contract

The conversation layer must convert casual user language into structured operating-system actions.

Each conversation turn must record:

* raw user message
* interpreted intent
* target project
* confidence level
* unresolved ambiguity
* extracted assumptions
* proposed next action
* whether execution was requested
* whether decisions are pending
* referenced documents or artifacts

### 10.1 Tone and Language Rules

The system must:

* reply naturally in the user’s language
* avoid unnecessary technical jargon for non-technical users
* remain friendly but precise
* clearly distinguish between suggestions and decisions
* clearly state when user approval is required

### 10.2 Clarification Rule

If the user’s message is too ambiguous to safely move planning forward, the system must ask one or more focused clarification questions before progressing.

### 10.3 Decision Escalation Rule

When multiple valid high-impact paths exist, the system must stop and ask the user to choose after showing differences and recommendation.

---

## 11. Discussion and Ideation Loop

The discussion loop is the layer that makes the system feel like a real project partner.

### 11.1 Inputs to the Loop

* raw idea
* project goals
* business constraints
* technical constraints
* target users
* geography or market focus if relevant

### 11.2 Outputs from the Loop

* refined idea statement
* identified assumptions
* opportunity analysis
* risk summary
* recommendation set
* candidate approaches

### 11.3 Mandatory Behaviors

The system must be able to:

* answer “can this be built?”
* answer “how can this be built?”
* answer “what are the risks?”
* answer “can this make money?”
* propose improvements
* compare multiple directions
* incorporate user rejection or acceptance into the next draft

### 11.4 Acceptance and Rejection Handling

The system must maintain explicit records of:

* accepted proposals
* rejected proposals
* postponed proposals
* forced constraints given by the user

No rejected idea may silently reappear in a later final plan unless the system explicitly asks to revisit it.

---

## 12. Option Decision Contract

Whenever there are multiple valid approaches, the system must present them as structured decision options.

Each option must contain:

* option id
* title
* description
* benefits
* drawbacks
* time impact
* complexity impact
* cost impact when relevant
* implementation implications
* recommendation level
* rationale for recommendation

### 12.1 Low-Impact Decisions

Low-impact decisions may be auto-selected by the system if the docs authorize it.

### 12.2 High-Impact Decisions

High-impact decisions must go to the user.
Examples:

* primary architecture path
* revenue model
* major scope inclusion/exclusion
* stack selection when tradeoffs are meaningful
* final execution approval

---

## 13. Documentation Build Loop

The system must not jump directly from idea to code.
Documentation must be built and reviewed in a controlled loop.

### 13.1 Documentation Types

Depending on project type, the system may generate:

* vision doc
* concept note
* business model summary
* scope definition
* feature specification
* architecture specification
* task breakdown
* execution plan
* review report
* delivery report

### 13.2 Documentation Loop Stages

1. first draft generation
2. self-review for completeness
3. contradiction detection
4. ambiguity detection
5. user review
6. revision
7. final approval

### 13.3 Stop Rule

No execution may begin until documentation enters `DOCS_APPROVED`.

### 13.4 Infinite Revision Principle

The system must support repeated review cycles without arbitrary limit until documentation is sufficiently approved.

---

## 14. Execution Handoff to Forge

Execution handoff is the boundary between the AI Operating System Layer and Forge Core.

### 14.1 What Must Exist Before Handoff

* project identified
* project state not blocked
* required decisions resolved
* documentation approved
* execution scope defined
* target files or outputs identified

### 14.2 Handoff Object Requirements

The handoff to Forge must include at minimum:

* project id
* execution id
* approved scope
* target project path
* requested outputs
* file or artifact targets
* dependency assumptions
* risk notes if relevant
* execution approval reference

### 14.3 Forge Responsibility After Handoff

Once handed off, Forge becomes responsible for:

* governed execution
* execution artifacts
* verification artifacts
* closure artifacts

### 14.4 AI Operating System Responsibility After Handoff

After handoff, the operating system remains responsible for:

* progress explanation to user
* interpreting execution results
* triggering next decision if needed
* delivery preparation

---

## 15. Verification Loop

Verification must occur during and after execution.

### 15.1 Incremental Verification

For each meaningful execution unit:

* execute
* verify
* compare to approved spec
* detect mismatch
* correct if needed
* verify again

### 15.2 Final Verification

The final result must be checked against:

* approved documentation
* user decisions
* stated delivery requirements
* runability requirements if applicable

### 15.3 Failure Handling

If verification fails:

* project enters correction loop
* user is informed in understandable language
* blocking issues are surfaced clearly
* no false “complete” state is returned

---

## 16. Delivery Contract

A project may only enter `DELIVERY_READY` when the system believes the requested result is complete enough to hand over.

### 16.1 Required Delivery Outputs

Depending on project type, delivery should include:

* final project output
* final documentation set
* run instructions
* setup instructions
* limitations and open items
* verification summary
* execution summary

### 16.2 Ready-to-Run Requirement

If the user asked for a runnable project, delivery must include a simple runbook.
Examples:

* how to install dependencies
* how to start the project
* required environment variables
* where to run commands

### 16.3 Delivery Explanation Style

The system must explain delivery in user-friendly language, especially for non-technical users.

---

## 17. Existing Project Review Contract

When a user asks to review a project, the operating system must enter review mode rather than build mode.

### 17.1 Review Inputs

* project root or main path
* selected branch/path if relevant
* user review goals

### 17.2 Review Outputs

* architecture findings
* code quality findings
* risk findings
* missing docs findings
* improvement opportunities
* prioritization suggestions
* recommended next actions

### 17.3 Review-to-Execution Bridge

The review output must not directly trigger execution.
It must first be converted into user-visible options or approved tasks.

---

## 18. Multi-Project Orchestration

The system must support multiple independent projects.

### 18.1 Isolation Principle

Each project must maintain independent:

* context
* state
* docs
* decisions
* artifacts
* execution history

No project may leak context into another project without explicit user request.

### 18.2 Project Switching

The interface must allow the user to:

* create a new project
* open an existing project
* switch among projects
* see status for each project

### 18.3 Parallel Handling

Projects may progress independently.
If multiple projects are active, each must show:

* current phase
* pending decisions
* whether blocked
* latest update

### 18.4 Group Operations

The system may support grouped review or grouped reporting across projects, but not mixed execution contexts unless explicitly designed.

---

## 19. Search and External Research Capability

For many user requests, the system must be able to analyze external information before refining the project.

Examples:

* market viability
* competitor signals
* implementation constraints
* monetization models
* current trends

### 19.1 Research Usage Rule

Research should be used during discussion and planning when the user asks for feasibility, value, competitive analysis, or current conditions.

### 19.2 Research Output Form

Research results should be converted into:

* concise summaries
* risks
* implications for the project
* recommendation adjustments

Research must inform planning but must not silently rewrite user goals.

---

## 20. Decision Ownership Rules

The operating system must distinguish between decisions it may make automatically and decisions that require user approval.

### 20.1 System-Autonomous Decisions

Examples:

* minor wording improvements in docs
* low-risk internal structuring choices
* low-impact formatting decisions

### 20.2 User-Owned Decisions

Examples:

* monetization path
* major architecture path
* major scope change
* final documentation approval
* final execution approval
* any choice with significant time/cost/risk implications

---

## 21. Non-Technical User Experience Requirements

Because the target user may not know coding, the system must be optimized for simplicity.

The system must:

* explain technical choices in plain language
* show recommendations before asking for decisions
* hide unnecessary technical complexity by default
* give exact next actions when the user must do something manually
* avoid assuming the user understands files, branches, environments, or pipelines unless the user demonstrates that knowledge

---

## 22. Interface Requirements

The user-facing system should eventually expose at least the following areas:

* Project List
* Active Project View
* Chat Panel
* Project Summary Panel
* Pending Decisions Panel
* Documentation Panel
* Execution Status Panel
* Verification Panel
* Artifact / History Panel

The user should always understand:

* which project is active
* what phase the project is in
* what the system is currently doing
* whether a decision is required
* whether execution has started
* what remains before delivery

---

## 23. What This Layer Must Not Do

The AI Operating System Layer must not:

* skip user approval for high-impact choices
* claim a project is complete without verification
* collapse multiple projects into one shared state
* silently override rejected user choices
* confuse conversation state with execution authority
* present planning as finished execution
* present brainstorming as approved design

---

## 24. Recommended Documentation Set for This Layer

The following new documents are recommended as the formal spec set for this operating system layer:

1. `docs/12_ai_os/01_AI_OS_VISION.md`
2. `docs/12_ai_os/02_USER_EXPERIENCE_MODEL.md`
3. `docs/12_ai_os/03_CONVERSATION_LAYER_CONTRACT.md`
4. `docs/12_ai_os/04_PROJECT_OBJECT_MODEL.md`
5. `docs/12_ai_os/05_PROJECT_LIFECYCLE.md`
6. `docs/12_ai_os/06_DISCUSSION_AND_IDEATION_LOOP.md`
7. `docs/12_ai_os/07_OPTION_DECISION_CONTRACT.md`
8. `docs/12_ai_os/08_DOCUMENTATION_BUILD_LOOP.md`
9. `docs/12_ai_os/09_EXECUTION_HANDOFF_TO_FORGE.md`
10. `docs/12_ai_os/10_EXISTING_PROJECT_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`
11. `docs/12_ai_os/11_MULTI_PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md`
12. `docs/12_ai_os/12_DELIVERY_AND_RUNBOOK_CONTRACT.md`

---

## 25. Initial Provider Positioning

For the first full version of this operating-system layer, the AI provider may be an OpenAI API integration.

At this stage, local edge inference is optional and not required by the core design.

That means:

* the conversation, planning, ideation, and document-generation intelligence may be powered by an OpenAI API provider
* Forge remains the execution authority
* any future edge or on-device inference remains an optional extension, not a foundational requirement for the first architecture

---

## 26. Final Design Summary

This operating-system layer exists to make Forge usable by normal humans.

Forge alone is an execution engine.
This layer turns the whole system into:

* a conversational partner for the user
* a planning and documentation system for the project
* a decision management system for major choices
* a handoff controller into Forge execution
* a delivery manager after verification

In simple terms:

The user should feel they are talking to a smart partner.
The system internally should behave like a project manager and planning engine.
Forge should remain the strict execution heart.

That is the full design intent of the Forge AI Operating System Layer.
