# Stage A — Contract Definition (TASK-002)

**Task ID:** TASK-002
**Task Name:** FORGE Documentation Audit & Architectural Alignment → then Code-vs-Docs Review
**Stage:** A
**Mode:** Documentation-Only (No Execution)
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed

---

## 1) Objective

Produce a closed, auditable, deterministic plan to:

1. Review all FORGE project documents for correctness, completeness, and internal consistency.
2. Apply required document fixes (add/replace/delete) while preserving governance rules.
3. Re-review documentation to confirm architecture connectivity (cross-links, precedence, contracts).
4. Only after documents are closed, perform a code review against the documents.

No code execution and no code changes are permitted in Stage A.

---

## 2) Scope

### In-Scope
- Full document review (repo docs + contracts).
- Traceability checks between documents (precedence, references, contracts).
- Identification of gaps, contradictions, duplicates, and missing gates.
- A deterministic list of exact document edits required (text + location).
- A deterministic verification loop for documents after edits.
- Preparation for subsequent Stage B/C for code-vs-docs compliance review.

### Out-of-Scope
- Implementing code changes.
- Running tests, builds, or tools.
- Refactoring, optimization, or enhancements not required to satisfy existing docs/contracts.

---

## 3) Required Inputs (Hard)

- Current repository snapshot (ZIP-first authority if provided).
- `progress/status.json` current values.
- All docs folders as defined by pipeline governance.
- Current code state (read-only in Stage A).

If any of the above is missing or ambiguous:
Stage A MUST enter BLOCKED with exactly one blocking question.

---

## 4) Required Outputs (Artifacts)

- `artifacts/stage_A/contract.md` (this file)
- `artifacts/stage_A/io_map.md`
- `artifacts/stage_A/pass_fail.md`
- `artifacts/stage_A/assumptions.md`

No artifact = No progress.

---

## 5) Deterministic Deliverables

Stage A MUST produce:

1. A closed review checklist for documentation.
2. A deterministic edit list (each edit: add/replace/delete + exact placement).
3. A deterministic re-review checklist after edits.
4. A deterministic plan for transitioning into code-vs-docs review (Stage B/C).

---

## 6) Governance & Boundaries

- No execution.
- No code modifications.
- No reopening closed stages.
- No suggestions outside the task scope.
- If multiple valid paths exist, Stage A MUST require a human selection (BLOCKED).

---

## 7) Stage Transition Rule

On Stage A PASS:
`next_step` MUST be Stage B: generate deterministic review plan artifacts for Docs Audit.

On Stage A BLOCKED:
`execution_state` MUST be BLOCKED, `blocking_questions` MUST contain exactly one question, `next_step` MUST be empty.

On Stage A ABORT:
Abort only if a contract violation is detected with no valid remediation path.
